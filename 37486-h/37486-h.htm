<h1>THE OUTDOOR CHUMS ON THE LAKE</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—THE BURNING STEAMBOAT</h2>
<p>
“Hurry up, and give the signal, Frank!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, let’s get the agony over with—either
Bluff is a better all-round paddler than I am, or
else he has to take water, that’s all!”
</p>
<p>
“Please hold your horses till I get a good focus
on you, fellows!” called Will Milton, the official
photographer of the Rod, Gun and Camera Club.
</p>
<p>
He stood on a little private dock, overlooking
Lake Camalot, and manipulated his camera with
the air of a professional.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, but you’ll have to wait a bit now,
boys,” replied Frank Langdon, the judge, who
was also seated in a cedar canoe very like those
of the contestants, only it was built for two, his
mate being Will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s gone wrong now, Frank?” demanded
Jerry Wallington, with his double-bladed paddle
poised for the first dip.
</p>
<p>
“Why, look at the <em>Eastern Star</em>—she’s making
her first Spring trip around the lake, and
heads in a line to cut you off your course,” declared
the referee.
</p>
<p>
“So much the worse for the poor old boat;
we’ll just have to run her down,” calmly observed
the youth called Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“I was only thinking of your being swamped
in the rough water she leaves in her wake. Better
relax your muscles for a few minutes, you impatient
braves.”
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your hard luck, what d’ye
think of that? Why, the plagued old boat’s just
gone and stopped where she blocks us off in
our little spin,” grumbled Jerry, in plain disgust.
</p>
<p>
“That settles it, then; we’ll surely have to sink
her,” remarked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on before you think of that. I’m afraid
there’s something wrong aboard, for Captain
Amos would never stop out there on the lake—at
least I never knew him to do such a thing
before,” said Frank, standing up in the canoe
to see better.
</p>
<p>
“Say, fellows, isn’t that smoke coming out of
the cabin?” demanded Will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“Smoke—why, perhaps the old tinderbox is
afire!” ejaculated Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s paddle out and see; perhaps we can be
of some help!” cried Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Come on, then!”
</p>
<p>
“Hey! you fellers hold on; where do I come
in?” shouted Will.
</p>
<p>
“You stay on the dock and get a snapshot of
the whole circus!” answered the unfeeling Jerry,
as he spurted away, urging his dainty craft along
with rapid strokes of his spruce blade.
</p>
<p>
“Marooned, I declare,” muttered Will; “but
perhaps I can improve the opportunity and get a
picture that will go down in the history of steamboating
on Lake Camalot.”
</p>
<p>
The three lads fairly flew over the intervening
water, which was almost smooth, as the breeze
hardly created a ripple on the surface.
</p>
<p>
Frank, having a larger boat to manage, fell
behind a trifle; but his arms were seasoned in
all manner of work, and he kept tagging along
close in the rear.
</p>
<p>
Apparently there was need for alarm, as the
smoke had rapidly increased in volume, and was
now pouring out of the little steamer.
</p>
<p>
At the same time they could plainly hear the
shouts of excited men; while the shriller voices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
that arose told that there were women passengers
aboard.
</p>
<p>
Dashing up to the side of the boat the boys
scrambled aboard, hastily securing their canoes
to any object that promised temporary anchorage.
</p>
<p>
Then they hurried to the cabin.
</p>
<p>
Here they found a scene of the utmost confusion.
Men were trying to dash buckets of water
upon the fire, which seemed to have gotten quite
a foothold. It even looked as though the first
trip of the little <em>Eastern Star</em> this season would
prove to be her last.
</p>
<p>
Captain Amos was plainly badly rattled by this
sudden emergency, though he was working like
a trooper to extinguish the flames, and leading
his two assistants, the engineer and deckhand, in
gallant rushes almost into the fire, where the contents
of the buckets they carried seemed to do
little or no good.
</p>
<p>
Frank Langdon was possessed of a cool head
in emergencies that called for tact. He made
an astonishing discovery as soon as he arrived
upon the scene of action. This consisted of the
fact that in the tremendous excitement, with the
passengers shrieking in his ears, the captain had
entirely forgotten the fact that the boat was
equipped with fire extinguishers.
</p>
<p>
“Here, fellows, get busy, strap this on my back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
and then get another. We’ve got to put out this
fire or some one will be burned to death, or
drowned. Don’t let any woman jump overboard!”
he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Jerry and Bluff seemed to catch some of the
spirit that animated their leader. They succeeded
in fastening the extinguisher to his back, even
though their hands trembled while so doing.
</p>
<p>
No sooner had this been done before Frank
was off, rushing directly toward the spot where
the flames seemed to have taken hold most
fiercely.
</p>
<p>
It was rather appalling, but somehow or
other the sight of the brave boy, equipped for
mastering the mounting flames, caused a little
cheer to arise from the excited passengers.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the prepared liquid from the little
apparatus began to spread over the fire, its ardor
was immediately checked. By the time Jerry
rushed alongside, similarly equipped, Frank was
getting the better of the conflagration.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t stop with the water, Captain Amos!”
shouted Frank, knowing that if their extinguishers
gave out before the fire was fully under control
it might spring up again into new life.
</p>
<p>
“Away, boys! Hand up the buckets!” cried
the captain.
</p>
<p>
Several of the male passengers, having by now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
partly recovered from their panic, started in to
assist. Between the whole lot the water came
faster, and in less than ten minutes the fire was
practically out.
</p>
<p>
There had been some damage done, but nothing
to seriously injure the steamboat; and a carpenter
could make repairs while the vessel was
covering a few daily runs in this balmy April
weather.
</p>
<p>
Captain Amos now found a chance to rush up
to Frank, and shake his hand vigorously.
</p>
<p>
He was a bluff chap, not much older than
Frank, a very good steamboatman, only that he
seemed apt to lose his head in a crisis, which
after all, must be a grave fault.
</p>
<p>
“Bully for you, Frank! Your coming saved
the boat, I believe. I’ll never forget it, I tell
you. Was just about to lay hold of those fire
extinguishers when your crowd forestalled me.
It was a rough deal all around. With those
women shrieking, and holding on to me, begging
me to save them, a fellow might be excused for
being a little slow to do the right thing. And
you, too, Jerry and Bluff—shake hands!”
</p>
<p>
“What set the boat afire?” asked the curious
Bluff, immediately.
</p>
<p>
The captain shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe it was an accident. We have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
always been mighty careful about leaving any
waste around where it could start into a flame.
Besides, if you notice, boys, you can see that it
started close to the cabin, and not near the boiler.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Amos involuntarily lowered his voice
and glanced suspiciously around while speaking.
His manner thrilled the boys as they had seldom
been before.
</p>
<p>
“Not an accident! Tell me about that, will
you? Do you mean that you believe some one
set the boat afire?” exclaimed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t speak so loud, please. That is what
I think. Unless it was intentional, I can’t imagine
how the thing started,” answered the young
captain, who was still much excited after his
recent experience.
</p>
<p>
“But it seems monstrous. Who would be
guilty of such a terrible thing?” asked Frank,
possibly dimly suspecting that the other might
be seeking to cover up some lack of proper caution
on his part, though that was not like Amos
Short.
</p>
<p>
“Say, did your crew mutiny?” gasped Bluff,
whose eyes were wide open with wonder over
this new development of the affair, and who had
lately been doing considerable reading of sea
tales.
</p>
<p>
“Well, hardly. I only have the engineer, an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
old faithful fellow; the pilot, who stuck to his
post through it all, and would have run us
ashore if the worst came; and one deck hand,
a darky,” he replied warmly.
</p>
<p>
“Then it was a passenger, you think?” demanded
Frank, determined to get at the bottom
of this new mystery.
</p>
<p>
“Well, none of my pay passengers. Listen
and I’ll tell you. This being the first trip this
year we were not so particular about taking pay.
At Newtonport a couple of tramps got aboard.
When I went to collect their fares they said they
had no money, but wanted to get across the lake
to Centerville. Rather than have a disturbance
on board I allowed them to remain, cautioning
them to stay below near the engine.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you are right, Captain; but what
could be their object in firing your boat?” asked
Frank.
</p>
<p>
One of the passengers hurriedly approached
at this moment. He was plainly much excited,
and as the fire was completely out it could not
have been from that cause.
</p>
<p>
“Captain, before you get into Centerville I
demand that you have every person on board this
boat searched!” he exclaimed vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Searched, Mr. Pemberton—what do you
mean?” exclaimed the captain, in dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“Because, sir, my luggage has been opened
while we were all excited about the fire, and my
property scattered about. I have been robbed
of something that was worth considerable money
to me, sir. And I intend to hold you and your
steamboat company liable for damages!” he cried
indignantly.
</p>
<p>
The captain looked at Frank—here then was
an explanation of the sudden fire!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—TWO CLEVER ROGUES</h2>
<p>
“This is a serious charge, Mr. Pemberton!”
said the captain, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
“But I mean it, every word, sir. I tell you
I have lost certain articles that represent a large
amount of money to me. And I shall proceed
against your company unless they are recovered,”
declared the passenger, angrily.
</p>
<p>
Frank believed he recognized in this party a
traveling agent who visited the jewelers in the
lake towns several times a year. This being the
case it was easy to understand that the packet
which he complained was stolen, might have
contained precious stones, or something along
that line.
</p>
<p>
“Stop and make sure before you say that, Mr.
Pemberton,” remarked the captain, turning pale
at the threat; for under the circumstances such
an action against the company might lose him his
comfortable berth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
For once his good-heartedness seemed to have
placed him in a predicament. According to the
plain rules of the company it should have been
his business, upon being refused the proper fare
by the two ugly tramps, to have called upon his
crew to assist him in putting them ashore, or getting
rid of them somehow, even if he had to
throw them overboard.
</p>
<p>
“I know just what I am saying, sir; the packet
is gone, and I am ready to swear that I left it
in my bag,” replied the other, firmly.
</p>
<p>
“But consider, sir, that in all this excitement
a man might lose his head. Just as likely as not
you may have done something with the packet
yourself. It would seem to be the first thing a
man might think of.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Amos was arguing with a view to
shifting the blame; but he had a positive customer
to deal with in Mr. Pemberton. The other
shook his head and frowned.
</p>
<p>
“I insist upon every one being searched before
they leave the boat,” he said. “No honest person
will object to such a course, I feel sure; and it
is the only safe way. And you yourself should
be the one to do the job, Captain, in the interest
of your company—of course with the assent of
the passengers and crew.”
</p>
<p>
The commander of the boat somehow at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
juncture looked at Frank, just as if he sought
advice from this source.
</p>
<p>
“It is the right thing to do, Captain,” that
party hastened to say, “and as for my two chums
and myself we would like you to begin right
now with us.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no necessity in your case, my boy;
for you have been under my eye all the time you
were aboard, and we owe you much,” the gentleman
hastened to exclaim.
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless, if any are to be searched all
should be without a single exception, to make it
fair. But it strikes me, Mr. Pemberton, that
the captain already has a pretty good idea as to
who took your valuables, if they have been stolen,
and not lost overboard in the confusion,” remarked
Frank, calmly.
</p>
<p>
The traveling jeweler whirled upon the officer.
</p>
<p>
“How is this, Captain?” he demanded, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“We were just wondering how the fire
started,” the other explained, “and I declared it
could not have come from any carelessness of
my crew, and that there was no chance of an
accident. In a word, sir, I vowed the fire must
be of incendiary origin. Frank, here, and his
friends were asking what reason any one would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
have for setting this boat on fire, when you
rushed up stating your loss.”
</p>
<p>
“I begin to grasp your meaning. It implies
that in order to cover up their robbery the thieves
started this fire, thinking that if the boat burned
no one might be the wiser. That looks very
plausible. Did I understand this boy to say you
had an idea concerning the identity of the criminal?”
Mr. Pemberton asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I believe I have,” said Captain Amos,
sturdily.
</p>
<p>
“Then I demand that you place him under
arrest immediately, before he can escape with
my property. Is there more than one concerned,
do you think? Ah! I have an idea I know whom
you mean—the two tramps who came aboard at
Newtonport?”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. They are the ones I suspect. It
would be easy to start such a blaze undetected,
for no one would be dreaming of such rascality,”
replied the officer.
</p>
<p>
“And taking advantage of the sudden confusion,”
went on the passenger, “when men and
women were shouting, and rushing frantically
about, they must have searched my luggage purposely,
knowing that I was carrying a valuable
packet in my bag.”
</p>
<p>
“That would appear to cover the case, sir. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
the light of this explanation do you still insist
upon every one being searched?” demanded Captain
Amos.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Pemberton also looked toward Frank, although,
perhaps, unconsciously. The latter
smiled and hastened to remark:
</p>
<p>
“I really believe that what the captain says
may be the true explanation of both the fire and
the robbery, Mr. Pemberton. And in that case
the arrest of the tramps will bring your valuables
to light.”
</p>
<p>
“Provided they have not gone overboard by
accident,” the captain could not resist saying,
with pointed emphasis.
</p>
<p>
The passenger shook his head doggedly, and
said:
</p>
<p>
“There is not the slightest chance of that, sir.
I vow I was not once near the spot where my
luggage was piled up from the first cry of fire
until just now, when I went to see that my things
were safe. Surely I would know it if I had gone
there.”
</p>
<p>
“Besides, Captain, unless I’m mistaken this
gentleman was the only one among the passengers
who seemed to have his senses; I am sure
I saw him helping to pass the buckets of water
along,” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Right you are, son,” said the gentleman, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
a faint smile; “for that is a fact. I forgot that
I even had any luggage aboard, and the cries
of those poor frightened women got on my nerves
so that I was bound to do all I could to assist
in saving the boat. Now, Captain Amos, I am
disposed to go as easy with you as possible, but
something must be done before you order the
boat into Centerville!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m willing to do anything that seems right,
only tell me what you wish,” replied the officer,
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“If those ugly-looking customers are guilty,
they must be apprehended before they have a
chance to secrete the goods,” vouchsafed Mr.
Pemberton.
</p>
<p>
“I agree with you. The only question is, ought
we try and do it here, or wait until we reach
the wharf, where we will find the constable waiting,
as he always is when the <em>Eastern Star</em>
arrives?”
</p>
<p>
“It might be safer to wait,” admitted the passenger,
“but in that event the rogues will be given
a chance to hide the packet, perhaps, about the
boat, trusting to getting it another time. Then,
as we would have no evidence that they were
guilty, we could not hold them.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, Frank?” asked the captain,
turning to the leader of the chums, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
by that action admitting that he entertained great
respect for the opinion of the boy who had done
so much to save the steamboat.
</p>
<p>
“I think the gentleman is right,” came the
quick response.
</p>
<p>
“That we ought to search the tramps now,”
queried the captain, anxiously; for he felt certain
that this move would bring on a fight, which
might add still further to the excitement of the
already terrified women aboard.
</p>
<p>
“Undoubtedly. Just as he says, they might
think it good policy to conceal their plunder somewhere
about the boat, hoping to get it later on,
after the excitement had died out. And if you
want any help in doing that same thing, Captain,
count on myself and two chums.”
</p>
<p>
The answer came so readily from the lips of
the canoeist that Captain Amos was almost overcome.
He thrust out his hand impulsively, exclaiming:
</p>
<p>
“Say, that’s awful kind of you, Frank. We
may need your assistance, for, to tell the truth,
those hoboes looked mighty tough, and I reckon
they’ll put up some sort of a fight before giving
in. I only hope they don’t happen to have any
sort of guns about them. Wait till I call up
Simmons the engineer, Codding the pilot, and
Adolphus the coon deckhand. If Mr. Pemberton gives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
us a hand we will have eight to cow
the rascals.”
</p>
<p>
“We will need the whole bunch if they are
half as tough as you say, Captain,” declared
Jerry, anxious to be heard.
</p>
<p>
The captain beckoned, and a negro boy came
running up.
</p>
<p>
“Go and tell the pilot and engineer to come
here at once, and you accompany them,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Yas, sah!” replied the willing worker, shooting
away with a look of curiosity toward the
others, as if wondering what new trouble had
arisen.
</p>
<p>
“That boy was working all the time, I believe,”
said Mr. Pemberton, thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Who, Adolphus?” asked the captain; “every
minute at my side; and I’d trust him with every
penny I owned. But here he comes, and both
men are with him. Now we can get ready to
look for those ragged tramps, and corner them.”
</p>
<p>
“H’m! when did you see them last?” asked
Frank, starting suddenly, as if he had made an
unpleasant discovery.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not since the cry of fire first broke
out. But what makes you ask such a question,
Frank?” demanded the captain, showing new
alarm.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I have an idea that it may be some little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
time before you get a chance to round those
scamps up, and proceed with your search. They
are the busy boys all right, and while we’ve been
talking matters over here the hobo couple have
been <em>doing</em> things. Look there, Captain, half
way to the other shore, and tell me what you
see!” and Frank pointed as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
Immediately a chorus of exclamations arose.
</p>
<p>
“As sure as you live, there they go like hot
cakes!” cried Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about nerve, if they haven’t
‘cribbed’ Frank and Will’s double canoe!” came
from Jerry’s lips, as he stared at the retreating
object.
</p>
<p>
“And just notice, fellows, that both of them
paddle as if they knew all about canoes. Those
hoboes have done some camping in their day, as
sure as you live!” observed Frank, always on the
lookout for these telling points.
</p>
<p>
“Say, do we stand here and let them get clean
away without lifting a hand?” exclaimed Bluff,
piteously.
</p>
<p>
“Hardly. Into your canoes, boys, and after
the thieves at full speed!” cried Frank.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—THE TELL-TALE PICTURE</h2>
<p>
Once again all was excitement aboard the
steamboat.
</p>
<p>
Jerry and Bluff dropped into their frail craft
with the practiced balance of experienced canoeists.
Frank did not mean to be left behind in
the wild race, managed to occupy a place
in the craft of Jerry. He seized upon the single
paddle, intending to work his passage, and make
up for the additional burden.
</p>
<p>
As they started off they could hear the captain
giving orders to the crew.
</p>
<p>
“He means to turn the boat around, and start
after the thieves himself!” cried Jerry, as he
dipped his double-blade swiftly on one side and
then the other.
</p>
<p>
Both little mosquito craft were by this time
fairly flying through the water. As those who
wielded the paddles faced forward they were able
to see what progress they made all the time
toward overhauling the escaping hoboes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“Not much hope,” declared Frank, finally.
</p>
<p>
“They’re two-thirds of the way in to shore.
We are gaining, but not enough by half to overhaul
them,” announced Bluff, making valiant
progress.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about this, but I hope Will sees his
opportunity to snap off a good view. This has
your race beat to a frazzle, Bluff!” shouted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“There comes the steamboat! The captain is
heading to cut them off,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“But he’s too far away. Besides, it’s too shallow
in there, and if he knows his business he’ll
never try to go much closer. A fire is bad
enough, not to speak of a stranded boat,” observed
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
The two men in the double canoe were working
like steam-engines to make progress. They
handled the paddles fairly well in unison, and as
Frank had said, showed a familiarity with the
blades that spoke of former experiences.
</p>
<p>
As the three boys paddled on they saw the
leading canoe shoot up on the shelving beach.
Then the tramps scrambled ashore.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on there, you!” bellowed Bluff, in his
excitement; “we want to talk with you!”
</p>
<p>
For answer the two men only made derisive
motions. Then they vanished in the thick
timber.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’re gone, all right, boys. I reckon it will
take some hunting to find such slippery rascals
again,” remarked Frank, with a laugh; for it
was not his packet that had been stolen, and he
had no reason to be deeply concerned.
</p>
<p>
“What will we do now?” demanded Bluff,
looking as disappointed as though he had just
lost a race.
</p>
<p>
“Recover our canoe, and put across the lake to
where Will stands on that dock.”
</p>
<p>
“But see here, Frank, do you mean to let those
fellows get away?” asked Jerry.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was always the impulsive one of the
four chums. His characteristic temperament
often got him into hot water. Only the preceding
Fall when the boys had taken a trip into the
woods, owing to a storm unroofing the Academy
at Centerville, as narrated in the preceding volume
of this series, entitled “The Outdoor Chums;
or, First Tour of the Rod, Gun and Camera
Club,” he had found himself precipitated into
numerous difficulties because of this failing.
Frank was frequently compelled to restrain this
impulsiveness on the part of his chum. On this
camping trip they had met with many strange
adventures, including an invasion of the camp
by a wildcat, a bear and also some enemies who
wished to do them harm by setting fire to their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
tents; Jerry had lost himself in the forest and
encountered numerous exciting adventures, and
there had followed a series of mishaps that had
all winter long given the chums a subject for
entertainment and discussion.
</p>
<p>
Frank was pleased to find that the tramps had
not been vindictive enough to try and do any
harm to the frail craft in which they had made
their escape from the steamboat.
</p>
<p>
For this he was disposed to feel a little kindly
toward them. It also made him more convinced
than ever that they must have a tender spot in
their evil hearts for a canoe, and could not bear
to smash up such a delicate little craft.
</p>
<p>
The steamboat was lying off-shore, and our
boys headed in such a direction that they could
talk back in answer to any questions asked by
the captain.
</p>
<p>
“Did they get clean away?” called the commander
of the boat, using his hands in lieu of
a megaphone.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon they did, Captain. They skipped
into the timber, and that was the last thing we
saw of them,” replied Frank, pausing for a
minute in his labor.
</p>
<p>
“That’s bad. We were in hopes you could
capture them,” said the other, looking plainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
worried over what future troubles were in store
for his company.
</p>
<p>
“Boys, I thank you for the trouble you took,
and hope to see you again,” shouted Mr. Pemberton.
“I’m going to get off at Centerville, and
engage the sheriff to hunt high and low for those
rascals. If you hear of anything, please look me
up. It is mighty important that I recover possession
of that missing packet.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, we’ll be glad to do so, sir. We
expect to spend the Easter holidays in the woods
somewhere along the lake, and it’s just possible
we may run across those two hoboes again,” answered
Frank, dipping his paddle in deeply again,
and sending his boat after those of his companions
that were flying on ahead.
</p>
<p>
They allowed him to catch up, for Jerry wanted
to ask a question or two.
</p>
<p>
“Say, do you really suppose we could meet
with those scamps again?” he said, eagerness
showing in his eyes; for Jerry loved excitement,
though fond of calling himself a square sportsman,
always giving the game every possible
chance.
</p>
<p>
“About one chance in ten; still, it’s there. If
they hang around here for any reason, and we’re
in the woods, you can see we might run across
the couple,” replied the other, quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your volunteer fire companies,
I reckon we’ve got a cinch on the prize
for rapid work,” cried Jerry. “Only for you,
Frank, that blessed old <em>Eastern Star</em> was sure
bound to go up in smoke. The company ought to
vote you a medal.”
</p>
<p>
“And there’s poor Will standing on the deck
waiting for us to come in and tell him what all
this fuss is about,” remarked Bluff, as they drew
near the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! you runaways, what in the wide world
was all that row out there?” demanded the
stranded canoeist, as the others glided in close to
the little wharf upon which he was sitting with
his legs dangling over, and the precious camera
gripped tight in his hands.
</p>
<p>
“All sorts of things happening. The boat was
on fire, and Frank here settled that by grabbing
up an extinguisher and turning the hose on the
flames, while the crew was handling the buckets.
The whole thing would have gone up if we hadn’t
arrived just in time. Then there was a robbery
aboard,” said Bluff, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“What! a robbery? Do you really mean it?”
gasped Will.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly. A jewelry salesman had a valuable
packet stolen from his stateroom. It is believed
that the fire was started just to cover the robbery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
While we were talking over matters, trying to
get the facts straight, and decided on arresting
a couple of hoboes aboard who were suspected
of doing the job, they ran away with the double
canoe, and escaped into the woods across
yonder,” went on Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Two hoboes! Why, I saw them standing at
the side of the steamboat looking down at the
canoes. They’ll appear in the picture I took
just then, for the smoke was rolling up, and the
view was magnificent,” declared Will.
</p>
<p>
Frank started and looked hastily out upon the
lake.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid it would be too far to recognize
the features of any one, even if you caught a
first-class view,” he remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Still there’s a little chance. A magnifier or
reading-glass might bring it out strong enough.
Anyhow, I’m going right home and make the try,
fellows. My roll is finished, and I might as well
develop it now as later.”
</p>
<p>
“Bring it around to-night when we meet at my
house to talk over our camping trip for the
Easter holidays,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you think we’ll go, boys?” asked
Bluff, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“For myself I’m in favor of Wildcat Island
at the southern end of the lake. Somehow, nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
ever goes there, and we could have a great
time, I imagine,” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, especially with the wild man that they
say has his den somewhere on that same old
island,” remarked Bluff, shrugging his shoulders,
as if the idea did not strike him favorably.
</p>
<p>
“Talk about your circus, a wild man appeals
to me every time!” said Jerry. “I’m in favor
of going there, particularly because it offers a
chance for excitement. Suppose we captured this
<em>thing</em> and found that it was a big monkey or
orang-outang that had escaped from some menagerie
long ago, wouldn’t that be something to
shout over? Me for Wildcat Island. How about
you, Will?”
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth I’ve always wanted to get
some good views of that lonely place, and I’ll
vote in favor of going there,” returned the young
photographer.
</p>
<p>
Bluff turned anxiously toward Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Are you backing these desperate schemers up
in this madness, Frank?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’d like to explore that place very
much. No one has ever done it, so far as I can
learn. Some say the island is haunted; others
that there are rattlers in plenty there, besides
furious wildcats; and then there’s this story told
about a wild man who has been seen several times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
on the shore of the island. Why, yes, I’m in
favor of going there to-morrow, when we start
out.”
</p>
<p>
Bluff threw up both hands.
</p>
<p>
“I give in. Three against one settles the matter
for keeps. Wildcat Island it is then for the
Easter camp. But I refuse to accept any of the
responsibility for whatever may happen,” declared
Bluff, firmly.
</p>
<p>
“Speak to me about a quitter, will you?
Listen to him knuckling down before we even
make a start. He claims to have bigger lungs
than me, does he? I’ll have to admit that he
can make a lot more noise when it comes to
squealing.”
</p>
<p>
Bluff Masters turned upon the other indignantly,
as he exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“Wait and see who turns white first when that
wild man bobs up. My lungs are in better shape
than yours, and I can prove it any old day. There
goes Will off, and I’m for following him. Bring
a print of each picture around to-night, old chap.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. And let’s hope they turn out decent,”
answered the other, waving a hand as he moved
away in the direction of town, leaving it to Frank
to paddle the big canoe to the landing where they
kept the cedar craft when not in the boathouse
of the club.

</p>
<p>
Frank was a busy fellow during the remainder
of the day. He had the job of laying in the
stores that were to see them through a whole
week in camp; and when four boys get out in
the open for that length of time it is simply
astonishing what an amount of food they can
dispose of.
</p>
<p>
But Frank had spent many a night under canvas
and bark covers in Maine, and, in fact, there
was little about camping he did not know. At
the same time he always made it a point to ask
questions whenever he ran across any one who
had also been through the mill; for in this way
even veterans may learn new wrinkles by exchanging
ideas.
</p>
<p>
About eight o’clock, Jerry and Will came in
together, as they lived close to one another. Bluff
was not a minute behind them, anxious for a view
of the pictures that had been taken that day.
</p>
<p>
“Say, how did they turn out?” he demanded,
as soon as he entered the room where Will was
opening an envelope, and Frank handling a large
reading-glass.
</p>
<p>
“Just bully, that’s what. Never got better results.
The water was in a beautiful ripple, you
see, and that always adds to a picture. Here,
take a look, fellows,” with which remark Will
scattered a lot of prints on the table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
He had certainly become quite a clever hand
at both developing his films and printing his
pictures, for the results were as clear as a bell.
</p>
<p>
“They do look fine,” commented Frank, as he
commenced to shuffle them over; “and the smoke
is pouring out of that old steamboat at a great
rate. I’m looking for the one you spoke about,
where those hoboes are standing in the sunlight
on the edge of the burning boat. Here it is.
Jerry, you would be apt to know better than I
could if either of these fellows has a familiar
face. Take a look.”
</p>
<p>
“If he don’t, perhaps I may. I’ve lived around
here three days longer than he ever did,”
grumbled Bluff.
</p>
<p>
Jerry bent down closer and continued to stare
through the reading-glass.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your luck, boys, this beats
the band!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Do you recognize one of them, then?” asked
Frank, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I do, and I’m surprised Captain Amos
didn’t. The dumpy one is Waddy Walsh, the
bad egg, who was sent to the reform school three
years ago. He must have escaped somehow,
and joined the army of tramps on the road,”
declared Jerry, positively.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—THE PADDLE TO WILDCAT ISLAND</h2>
<p>
“Waddy Walsh!” exclaimed Bluff, showing
sudden interest. “Let me look, Jerry!”
</p>
<p>
“Will you give an honest opinion, regardless
of any bias, one way or the other?” demanded the
other, whose father was a leading lawyer in
Centerville.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I will. What do you take me for,
anyway?” replied Bluff, aggrieved.
</p>
<p>
“Then look, and tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,” and Jerry handed him
the reading-glass.
</p>
<p>
“Well, what’s the verdict?” asked Frank, after
Bluff had studied the picture for a full minute.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t be as positive as our friend here, but
I’m inclined to think that it may be Waddy, all
right; anyhow, he’s about his size, and there’s
something in his way of standing that reminds
me of the fellow,” announced Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your hedging, what d’ye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
think of that? Of course it’s Waddy, as big as
life, grown somewhat, and with torn clothes and
dirty face; but I’d know his attitude among a
dozen. Consider that point settled, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it doesn’t matter much to us at all. If
the sheriff, Mr. Dodd, manages to catch up with
the runaways, Mr. Waddy will have a chance to
go back to where he came from—the reform
school. Now, let’s drop those two, and talk over
our proposed visit to Wildcat Island,” remarked
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Have you got all the supplies?” asked Will.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s the list. Look it over, and if anybody
wants to suggest other things all they have
to do is to put them down. We’re willing to lug
stuff there to the limit of our canoes,” answered
Frank.
</p>
<p>
When they had made all arrangements the
meeting was adjourned to the time when they expected
to start from the boathouse just after
noon on the following day.
</p>
<p>
“How about the weather—do we go, regardless?”
asked Will, again.
</p>
<p>
“True canoeists laugh at the weather. Come
rain, come storm, they buck up against whatever
the day brings forth. At one, then, every fellow
be on hand. I’ll have the supplies there before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
that. I’ve got a surprise in store for you boys,
too,” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about that, will you; he’s going to
let us lie awake all night trying to guess the
great conundrum. Say, it hasn’t anything to
do with the girls coming over some day to take
dinner with us, has it?” asked Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! say, that would be immense, only too
good to be true,” cried Bluff, who, be it known,
was rather inclined to be sweet on Frank’s only
sister, Nellie.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve promised to come, all right; but this
has nothing to do with that. You just wait and
see, that’s all I’ll say. Now come into the front
room, fellows. Nellie has had several friends
over, and we’re going to make a delightful
evening of it.”
</p>
<p>
Frank would not listen to any protest, but
ushered his three chums into the parlor where
they found four lively girls enjoying themselves
with music, and waiting for the meeting of the
club to come to an end.
</p>
<p>
For the next hour they romped as only a lot of
young people may, for whom the morrow has no
terrors. Will’s twin sister, Violet, was, of course,
there, as were Mame Crosby and Susie Prescott,
the former of whom was never so happy as when
teasing Jerry, and getting him to “spout” after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
the fashion of his learned father when pleading
for a prisoner before the bar.
</p>
<p>
It was about half-past ten that they separated,
after enjoying some simple refreshments in the
way of cake and lemonade.
</p>
<p>
The boys saw the girls home, Will taking his
sister; while Bluff, secretly informing Nellie
Langdon that he only did it out of pure courtesy,
saw that Susie was properly escorted through
the quiet streets of Centerville, and reached her
father’s house in safety.
</p>
<p>
When Frank reached the boathouse, just at
half-past twelve on the following day, he found
all of his companions there ahead of him.
</p>
<p>
“You slow coach, think we’ve got the whole
afternoon to get started?” demanded Bluff, who
was bustling around as usual, yet accomplishing
very little.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if you examine closer you’ll find that
I’ve been here most of the morning, and packed
the things in several bundles. These go in the
big canoe; those yonder you must stow away,
Bluff, while Jerry will take care of the rest,”
replied Frank, paying little attention to the way
in which he was addressed, because he knew it
was mere talk, and no slur intended.
</p>
<p>
“Sure you didn’t miss anything?” asked Jerry,
smiling grimly; for he pretended to scorn this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
wholesale carrying of stuff into the woods, and
always declared he could exist happily with a
blanket, a coffee-pot, a frying-pan, some salt and
pepper, coffee and ship biscuit, depending on rod
and gun to supply all else.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, when the “duffle” was lugged
into the woods he considered it a sacred duty to
do his utmost to lessen the supplies, possibly for
fear they would have to “tote” them out again,
as Bluff used to sarcastically remark.
</p>
<p>
“Not that I know of. If you are afraid, why
we might go over the list again, and see what
else we can use,” said Frank, with a wink toward
Will.
</p>
<p>
“I beg of you don’t. My poor canoe would
sink of fright or freight. Besides, I want you to
notice that it’s kind of rough out on the lake,
and as it stands we’re taking big chances of being
swamped. Come on, fellows, load your cargo!”
called Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“What’s this funny bundle in our boat?” demanded
Will, suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Ask no questions and I’ll give you no yarns.
Just possess your souls in patience, and you’ll see
after a while,” came Frank’s answer, as he went
on loading systematically, taking heed of the fact
that they would need to buck up against some
rather heavy seas from the south while on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
way, and that everything must be protected from
the wet by covers.
</p>
<p>
“I bet it’s a new patent stove he’s got along,”
suggested Will.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! that’s in my boat already. It burns
kerosene, and makes a blue gas. Frank says it’s
the boss in rainy weather, with those aluminum
camp kettles for cooking. I reckon it must be
a box of cake and pies the girls have supplied,”
ventured Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“You’re away off, for they’re going to bring
those things when they come. Besides, this isn’t
in the shape of a box at all,” laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a fact, and it looks more like a spare
blanket or two,” came from Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Well, give it up, boys. I don’t believe you’d
guess in a month of Sundays. Now, are you all
ready?” queried the leader of the club, as he
took up his paddle and prepared to look after the
port side while Will worked the starboard.
</p>
<p>
Frank, being the more experienced of the
twain, had the stern seat, as that is usually considered
the post of greater responsibility in clearing
rocks while running rapids, and generally
guiding the craft.
</p>
<p>
“Say when!” called Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Red Rover</em> is ready to meet the storm!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
announced Bluff, whose little craft had a narrow
band of red around its gunwale.
</p>
<p>
“Go!”
</p>
<p>
The four paddles dipped deeply into the
water, and simultaneously the little canoes
started into the teeth of the wind. There were
a few shouts from the shore, and considerable
waving of snowy ’kerchiefs from a group of girls
standing before Frank’s house, which latter
brought a series of salutes from the paddlers until
the commodore of the flotilla sternly warned
them that unless they paid more attention to what
they were doing an upset would mark the beginning
of their Spring outing.
</p>
<p>
After that they kept their eyes straight ahead.
And, indeed, there was really need for all attention,
since the waves were running quite high
for such small vessels to meet. Still, a canoe, if
properly handled, can live in a sea that will sink
a much larger boat; since the tiny cedar craft
mounts to the crests of the waves with the buoyancy
of a cork.
</p>
<p>
They paddled strenuously for an hour toward
the south, and by that time were beginning to feel
their muscles growing somewhat sore. The season
was young, and they had not as yet become
wholly accustomed to hard manual labor, though
all of them used the school gymnasium through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
the winter months in the endeavor to keep in
condition.
</p>
<p>
“Talk about your combers, these are the real
thing,” grunted Jerry, as he shot up on the crest
of a wave, from which exalted position he had
a fleeting view of the island dead ahead; and
was then swept down into what seemed to be
a valley.
</p>
<p>
The fact that each boat was so heavily laden
added to the danger of their swamping if once
they turned sideways to the seas, or broached
to; but the boys were conscious of this ever-impending
peril, and fought tooth and nail to prevent
it.
</p>
<p>
Wildcat Island was quite a large piece of
ground, standing in the lake at some little distance
from either shore, but much nearer the
western one, that upon which the town of Newtonport
was situated, with its distant range of
hills, called the Sunset Mountains by the natives.
</p>
<p>
This island lay not far from the foot of the
lake, while another, going by the name of Snake
Island, was situated close to the lumber camp
at the head of the body of water, which was some
ten miles long by between one and two wide.
</p>
<p>
With a strong south wind blowing, a heavy sea
could be kicked up, though naturally this would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
be found much worse the farther up the lake one
went.
</p>
<p>
“Ten minutes more will see us there, boys!”
shouted Frank.
</p>
<p>
He feared that one of the other paddlers might
be getting pretty near his last effort, and wished
to encourage the balance of his chums to renewed
efforts.
</p>
<p>
“We’re all right; don’t worry about us,” called
back Bluff, who happened to be a little bit ahead.
</p>
<p>
He had hardly spoken than he came close to
the verge of disaster. To make his voice carry
the better, Bluff had half turned his head, and in
doing this lost his advantage just a trifle. So
it came that the next sea struck the <em>Red Rover</em>
on the forward port side, instead of head on.
This caused the frail canoe to sheer out of her
course, amid frantic efforts of her wearied skipper
to regain a straightaway heading; and only
for the fact that a second sea did not follow
closely on the heels of the first, he might have
met with an upset.
</p>
<p>
Presently they ran into the lee of the island,
where the water was smoother.
</p>
<p>
This revived the flagging energies of Bluff and
Jerry, always rivaling each other in whatever
they attempted; so they set up a little race for
the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who won, Frank?” demanded Bluff between
gasps, as all of them landed.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” remarked the other, with a sly wink
at Will, which at the time the latter did not fully
understand, though its import was made plain
later, “I’d declare it a dead heat! You two fellows
are so evenly matched it’s hard to decide
which is the better.”
</p>
<p>
“All but our lung capacity; there I’ve got him
beaten every time,” insisted Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“You have, eh? Wait until the opportunity
comes, and you’ll just see how easy I put you on
the mat. Ashore it is, my hearties! We’re castaway
sailors for a week!” exclaimed Jerry, suiting
the action to the word, and dragging his
canoe up on the little shelving beach, beyond
which lay the bristling thickets, hiding all the
mysteries of Wildcat Island.
</p>
<p>
“Monarch of all we survey. Here we hide
from the world, and forget dull care,” sang Will,
prancing about to ease up his strained muscles.
</p>
<p>
“Here, lend a helping hand, you shirk!” called
Frank, who was dragging the big canoe ashore
alone.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there was a shriek from Will that
made the others spring up. Frank’s hand involuntarily
reached out for the double-barreled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
shotgun that lay in its waterproof case on top
of the stuff in his canoe.
</p>
<p>
“Look! look! the wild man!” shouted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
They all saw a hideous face framed among the
branches and twigs of the thicket close by. One
second only was it in view, hardly long enough
for them to make out that it was human rather
than that of an immense ape. Then the ugly
face vanished from their sight, leaving the four
canoeists gaping at each other as though unable
to positively decide whether they had really seen
the mysterious wild man of the island, or something
which their imaginations had conjured up
instead.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—A STRANGE HAPPENING</h2>
<p>
“Did you see him, boys?” exclaimed Will, who
was shivering as if he had just run across a
ghost.
</p>
<p>
“Why, to be sure,” replied Frank, laughing a
little forcedly; for the sight of that hideous face
had given him a shock.
</p>
<p>
“Then it was so, after all. I began to believe
I was just imagining things. Oh! what a magnificent
opportunity I missed. How can I ever
forgive myself?” groaned Will, showing signs of
disgust.
</p>
<p>
“Opportunity for what—capturing the terrible
wild man?” cried Bluff, aghast at what seemed
the audacity of his ordinarily peaceable chum.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not. But if I had only been ready
I could have taken his picture to show the folks
at home. My stars! what a great feat that would
have been,” sighed the disappointed photographer,
shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about that, will you? There was my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
uncle laughing at me when I mentioned about
this same wild man of the island. He declared
it was only some innocent animal, or else an old
woman’s tale. But every one of us saw him, and
we’ve not been ashore five minutes, either,” declared
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“I foresee some stirring times for us here, what
with the snakes, if they are to be found, the
ferocious wildcats they tell about, and now this
mysterious wild man,” remarked Frank, soberly,
as he began to take the bundles out of his canoe
and place them high and dry up on the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Are we going to stay?” asked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Why, to be sure we are. Talk to me about
your brave men, I like to hear a fellow speak
about being scared away by the first sight of some
poor, harmless chap. Perhaps it’s another of
Mr. Smithson’s crazy people, escaped from the
asylum over at Merrick, and hiding out here.”
</p>
<p>
On their camping-out trip of the preceding
autumn they had met with a remarkable personage
who persisted in declaring that he was the
famous Prince Bismarck, and who eventually
turned out to be an escaped inmate of the asylum
at Merrick, some miles away.
</p>
<p>
A keeper named Smithson had engaged them
to help him capture the demented one, and this
was what Jerry was referring to when he spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t wonder but what that may be
true,” remarked Frank, seriously; “but no matter,
we are not the kind to run at a shadow. We
laid out this trip to spend our Easter holidays on
Wildcat Island, and it’s got to be something
pretty threatening that will frighten us off.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear! hear!” exclaimed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the stuff!” declared Bluff, thinking that
he could not afford to let his rival take all the
credit for valor.
</p>
<p>
“But I’ll never get another opportunity to
take his picture,” complained Will.
</p>
<p>
“How do you know? Man alive, there may
be no end of stirring times coming, with that
same old hermit figuring in the circus. Perhaps
the scent of our coffee and bacon will bring him
back into touch with civilization; why, he may
even walk into our camp, and try to make friends,
when he gets a whiff of onions frying,” and
Frank slapped his chum on the back as he spoke
along this line.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! well, if you think that way I’ll keep up
my hopes. And you just remember that if I
seem to be hugging this little snapshot contrivance
closer than usual, why, I’m only keeping in
readiness for instantaneous work. A fellow has
to be pretty quick on the trigger to get a picture
of a wild man, you know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
They soon had the boats unloaded.
</p>
<p>
“Pull them out, fellows. I’ve brought along
the chains and padlocks belonging to each boat.
Having a canoe stolen isn’t such fun, even on
a ten-mile lake like Camalot,” ventured Frank,
as he produced the articles in question, and proceeded
to fasten the canoes together, at the same
time making sure they were chained to the sturdy
root of a nearby tree.
</p>
<p>
“He thinks of everything,” admitted Will, in
admiration.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you believe it for one second. I forget
many things; but as they said a wild man inhabited
this bit of island, I wanted to make sure
he did not run off with any of our boats, and
perhaps our supplies.”
</p>
<p>
“All the same, it took your long head to think
of such a thing, old chap. Now, I defy any one
to hook our boats. Besides, we don’t mean to
ever leave the camp unguarded; and I guess you
expect to put up the tents close by here?” said
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“It looks good to me,” replied Frank, casting
another glance at the little open spot close
to the beach, which seemed an ideal place for a
canoeist’s camp, having a splendid view of the
lake, stretching almost ten miles away to the
north.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
The four were soon as busy as beavers.
</p>
<p>
They already knew how to erect the tents,
which had a fly that could be lowered in front in
severe weather, and a ground cloth of waterproof
material, quite an addition to the comfort
of the interior.
</p>
<p>
Jerry worked just as hard as the rest, although
every now and then pretending to laugh at all
this fuss, when a humble shack of branches
ought to serve any fellow who called himself a
true sportsman.
</p>
<p>
By the time the fireplace had been built of
stones, over which several stout steel bars rested,
upon which the cooking utensils would set, the
Spring afternoon was drawing to a close.
</p>
<p>
“What will we have for our first supper?”
Bluff asked; for he did not mean to let Jerry
carry off all the honors in the cooking line this
trip.
</p>
<p>
Secretly Bluff had been getting the hired girl
at his home to teach him some of the kitchen lore,
and he had a few surprises up his sleeve which
he intended to spring upon his unsuspecting
chums when the occasion came around that he
was left alone in charge of the camp.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody thought to bring a steak this time,”
ventured Frank; “so if you’re all agreeable, I
say that we begin our cooking with a little canoeist’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
menu something along this order: Tea, succotash,
a can of corned beef, fresh bread and
butter, and finish with a jar of preserves and
cake from home. How does that strike you?”
</p>
<p>
“It suits me. And as the sun is sinking low,
the sooner we get to work the better,” declared
Bluff, readily enough; for he was fairly ravenous,
and kept wetting his lips like a hungry dog
that scents a rich, juicy bone.
</p>
<p>
“Talk about your feasts, what could equal that
programme? Me for the corned beef every time.
Why, it’s my best hold, and I just worship it—hot,
cold or medium. How do you stand, Will?
Any further suggestions?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I brought some imported Switzer cheese
along, and you know, fellows, I’m particularly
fond of it; so if it’s just the same to you, I’ll
add that to the list,” replied the one addressed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my! that’s what I get for speaking too
hastily. Now I shall certainly be punished. I
suppose as long as that cheese lasts my appetite
will vanish at every meal. I only hope that gay
old wild man takes a fancy to it, and elopes with
the whole blessed bunch. Why didn’t you fetch
limburger and kill us outright, instead of our
dying by inches? But it will help draw the wildcats
around, that’s one comfort,” groaned Jerry.
</p>
<p>
Preparations for supper went on apace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
They had set the tents at the base of a little
bluff; for Wildcat Island was a singular formation,
being quite hilly in parts. Indeed, some
people were fond of comparing it to the volcanic
islands that suddenly rise up out of the sea in
regions like the Alaska coast; and as frequently
vanish in a night. It was moreover heavily
wooded, and the rank vegetation made it anything
but an easy task to do any exploring.
</p>
<p>
Frank had calculated that this steep bluff overhanging
the camp would be of considerable benefit
to the expedition should a severe storm set in
from the west.
</p>
<p>
As the boys busied themselves with various
tasks they chatted and joked after their custom.
</p>
<p>
The stew of succotash and corned beef, which
Frank had called the Canoeist’s Delight, was now
ready. He set it aside on a stone to cool a trifle
while the table was being prepared.
</p>
<p>
“How’s the coffee getting on, Jerry?” asked
the chief cook of the evening; for they usually
changed around, and gave each fellow a chance
to show what he knew along the line of preparing
appetizing dishes, or of exposing his ignorance,
which method of procedure naturally created
some rivalry.
</p>
<p>
“Just about ready. I’ve allowed it to boil furiously
three times, and settled it with a dash of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
cold water on each and every occasion. Talk to
me about the nectar of the gods, this suits me all
right.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! please hurry up. I’m almost trembling
with eagerness, after sitting here and sniffing
those delicious odors for so long a time,” pleaded
Will, who happened to have nothing to do with
the supper on this occasion, his time coming on
the morrow.
</p>
<p>
But they gave him no heed, those unfeeling
wretches.
</p>
<p>
The one who camps out must expect to prove
himself a hero daily by conquering his appetite
and holding it in check with a firm hand until the
head chef declares that all is ready for the feast
to begin.
</p>
<p>
Frank had just finished placing the aluminum
plates and cups, and was about to reach out for
the kettle of steaming stew, when to his astonishment
he found the stone, where he had laid it,
empty.
</p>
<p>
Thinking that one of the others might be playing
some trick, he opened his mouth to remonstrate,
when a cry from Will caused him to turn
his eyes upward.
</p>
<p>
There he saw the little kettle swinging in mid-air,
and being drawn hastily upwards by some
unseen mysterious agency!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—FRANK MAKES A GUESS</h2>
<p>
No one seemed able to say a single word.
</p>
<p>
Standing or crouching there, with staring eyes
those four lads watched the marvelous ascent of
their supper. It was as though an unseen hand
had reached down and plucked the kettle from the
rock to carry it heavenward.
</p>
<p>
Now it had reached the level of the top of
the bluff, and as they continued to gape, an arm
was thrust hastily out from the rank vegetation
that grew there; they saw eager fingers clutch
the kettle, and then it was drawn from their sight.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about that!” gasped Jerry, as soon as
he could catch his breath.
</p>
<p>
Bluff made a dive for Frank’s gun. His own
repeating shotgun was at home, out of commission,
for which Jerry, who hated the modern arm
as the devil is said to hate holy water, never ceased
to give thanks.
</p>
<p>
But Frank caught his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, I wouldn’t do that, Bluff. We can afford
to lose our stew, for we’ve got plenty more
behind it. We can even let the little kettle go,
if necessary; but we should hate to have any
man’s life on our hands, no matter if he is a
crazy being.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you see him, Frank?” exclaimed Will, in
great excitement.
</p>
<p>
“No more than the rest of you. An arm came
into view, and the kettle was drawn in. Somebody
is going to enjoy a fine supper to-night.
Perhaps the poor fellow has not tasted decent
food for ages. Much good may it do him,”
said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do about it, then?”
demanded the warlike Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Well, the best thing is to open another can
of succotash and one of the corned beef, since
we seem to have set our minds on that stew,”
smiled Frank.
</p>
<p>
He immediately started operations.
</p>
<p>
“But are we going to sit here like a lot of
babies while that scamp runs off with our supper?”
demanded Bluff, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“And he’s stolen one of your charming little
aluminum kettles, too, Frank,” put in Will, in
added horror.
</p>
<p>
“Well, there are plenty more where that came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
from, and an indulgent dad will, I am sure,
supply me with all I want; but I should hate to
have to tell him that I had filled a poor demented
being with bird-shot just because the tantalizing
odor of my favorite canoeist stew had tempted
him beyond endurance.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you think the beggar ever did it?”
asked Jerry at this juncture, as he craned his
neck to look straight upward.
</p>
<p>
“I think I can see how. I noticed a cord of
some sort. Evidently he had a hook attached.
This he passed over that branch of a tree sticking
out from the top of the bluff, so that the kettle
might be kept away from the face of the cliff
as it rose, and in that way prevented from spilling
its coveted contents,” replied the one addressed.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your aeroplanes, that was
an ascension to beat the band! Wow! I had a
chill run up and down my spinal column, for I
give you my word, fellows, at first I really
thought of ghosts, and that some invisible agency
had reached down and gobbled our supper.”
</p>
<p>
“And I thought I was dreaming—that I’d
fallen asleep by the fire, and you had eaten up
all the stew, while Bluff was throwing up the
empty kettle to practice shooting at, like he did
our wash-basin that other time,” admitted Will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“And that chap was angling for the bale of
our kettle while we sat here and never once suspected
what was going on. Say, we’re a husky
lot of tenderfeet. Why, some night a thief will
come and steal the blankets off us, and no one
be the wiser until morning,” declared Bluff, in
disgust.
</p>
<p>
After a while the second kettle of stew was
pronounced ready. It was laughable to see how
those four crowded around to protect it against an
invading force; and what suspicious looks they
cast upward at the brow of the innocent little
bluff.
</p>
<p>
But there was no further manifestation of the
Presence near them. Jerry kept an eye on the
coffee-pot, and was ready with a keen-edged
knife to immediately proceed against any dangling
cord and hook that might come in sight.
</p>
<p>
They enjoyed the supper in spite of the uncanny
feeling that this unprovoked and early
attack had produced.
</p>
<p>
“Who was it predicted that the odors of our
cooking would stir up the old hermit, and awaken
his appetite for the things of the civilized world?
Frank, it was you. And sure enough that’s what
came to pass. He’s got tired of feeding on roots
and birds’ eggs and fish,” remarked Will, feeling better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
after he had quieted the gnawings of
his appetite.
</p>
<p>
“Provided that it was the so-called wild man,”
said Frank, quietly.
</p>
<p>
At which remark there was a chorus of cries.
</p>
<p>
“It certainly must have been a human being
and not an animal. Even an educated ape or
chimpanzee could never have had that cord and
hook and managed it as this chap did. What
do you mean by doubting it, Frank?” demanded
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, tell us what you’ve been thinking?”
asked Will.
</p>
<p>
“Say, that gives me an idea. I wager I can
guess what he’s got in mind,” ventured Jerry,
looking exceedingly wise.
</p>
<p>
“Well, go on then,” from Frank.
</p>
<p>
“The two runaway tramps!”
</p>
<p>
“Jerry, that head of yours will get you into
trouble some day. You are too good a guesser,”
laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Then that was it? You think the tramps
have come over here to Wildcat Island to hide
while the sheriff is hunting the woods high and
low for them? I declare, if that’s so it means
warm times in store for us,” exclaimed Will.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your war scares, what could
equal that? Why, we’ll capture the blooming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
hoboes, and let Mr. Dodd know there are others
besides himself who can do things.”
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think that?” pursued Bluff,
who always wanted to know the why and wherefore
of everything, he being the Doubting
Thomas of the quartet.
</p>
<p>
“I may be mistaken, remember; for I’m just
speculating, you see. In the first place, I doubt
if our wild man would be provided with such
a convenient cord and hook. Then again I saw
that arm, and it was covered with a sleeve that
looked wonderfully like that of the taller tramp’s
coat, a dun-colored affair.”
</p>
<p>
“Bravo! Frank’s logic carries the day. I’m
going to take it for granted that we are entertaining
angels unawares on this blessed old
island,” cried Will.
</p>
<p>
“Angels?” snorted Jerry. “Talk to me about
that, will you? They must have had their wings
singed, then, or else they’d have flown down and
scooped our grub instead of using a measly old
string. Angels! Wow! Will’s turning poet as
well as artist.”
</p>
<p>
“I know one thing, boys, and that is we’ll have
to keep watch and watch every night from now
on. If the tramps are here they’ll steal everything
we own, given half a chance,” from Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good idea, and we’ll arrange that one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
must be on guard for two hours at a stretch.
Besides, it will make the camp seem more military,”
said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I rather like the idea, and ask to be appointed
the first keeper of the watch,” spoke up Will.
</p>
<p>
An arrangement was soon completed. By
means of a system each of the boys would be on
duty as a guard two hours of the night. This
would cover the time from ten to six, which
allowed the sleepers ample time to recuperate.
</p>
<p>
They passed a pleasant evening despite the
many suspicious glances cast aloft from time to
time. Finally Jerry began to yawn.
</p>
<p>
“Say, fellows, as I’m the last to go on duty,
I guess I’ll turn in. To-morrow I mean to collect
a lot of hemlock browse for a bed; but
to-night it’s me on the cold, hard ground, with
only my good blanket under and above.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit of it, old chap. Here’s where my
surprise comes in. Now, you and our good
friend Bluff here have been sighing for a chance
to prove which one possesses the biggest lungs.
I’m going to give you a chance to make good,”
announced Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah! count me in, whatever it is,” exclaimed
Bluff, jumping up, as Frank began to
undo the mysterious bundle that had excited their
curiosity earlier.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“Here you see a couple of the finest rubber
air-cushion mattresses ever made for the use of
campers. Each can be extended so that two can
sleep on it. Now, I’m going to spread these out
here ready. You two will lie down on your
chests, and wait till I give the signal, and then
blow for all you’re worth. The first one whose
mattress is filled with air will be proclaimed the
victor,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
Jerry and Bluff threw themselves prostrate instantly,
eager for the trial, and each filled with a
determination to settle the matter for all time.
They did not see the sly wink Frank gave Will,
nor hear the chuckling sound of amusement that
escaped from the lips of that camper as he half
turned his head away.
</p>
<p>
“Go!”
</p>
<p>
Frank stood there as referee and timed the
contestants, who puffed and blew with all the
vigor of their young lungs, until both mattresses
stood out just as full as they could stand.
</p>
<p>
“How is it?” wheezed Bluff, looking up, red
in the face.
</p>
<p>
“Do I win?” gasped Jerry, too exhausted to
do more than roll over.
</p>
<p>
“Gentlemen, it has been a remarkable contest
all around. I am forced to call it a draw for
to-night, as you both came under the wire at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
the same time. It is simply wonderful!” announced
the judge, gravely.
</p>
<p>
Will mutely held up his hands, but whether
to express his admiration for the capacity of the
contestants’ lungs or for the astonishing ingenuity
of Frank, could not be told. He knew that they
would never have any trouble about getting those
two air mattresses filled each night, for the eager
rivals could hardly wait for turning-in time to
come, so anxious were they for a new trial of
lung capacity.
</p>
<p>
Frank had not camped in Maine for nothing.
He afterwards admitted in secret to Will that
he had witnessed a similar trick being played
upon a couple of guides, and had never forgotten
it.
</p>
<p>
“Just you wait until to-morrow night, and I’ll
show you,” grunted Jerry, as he rolled over to
woo the goddess of slumber.
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ll have to go a notch better than
you did just now, that’s what,” was the pugnacious
reply of his rival.
</p>
<p>
“How does it go, Jerry?” asked Will, whose
watch came first, and who was handling Frank’s
gun a bit nervously, for he was a poor shot.
</p>
<p>
“Fine. Frank, you deserve the united thanks
of the club for thinking of such things as these.
Talk to me about your bed of hemlock browse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
it’s all good enough to read about, but this is
solid comfort!” said Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“That settles it. They must be great when
such a simple-minded sportsman as you would
praise them. Here goes, fellows,” and Frank
lay down.
</p>
<p>
Ere long the camp was quiet, save for the
strenuous breathing of Bluff, who persisted in
lying on his back, and gently snoring. Will sat
out his watch and then awoke Frank, whose
turn came after him.
</p>
<p>
It was just about midnight when he took up
his station where he could see all that went on
in the camp. He meant to keep a good watch,
because, if those rascally tramps were really on
the island it was more than possible that they
would sooner or later try to make another raid
on the larder of the boys in order to satisfy
their hunger.
</p>
<p>
The moon had risen long before, but was hidden
behind a bank of heavy clouds.
</p>
<p>
Frank was trying to figure out how he ought
to act under such conditions. He had said that
he did not want to do the tramps bodily injury
if it could be prevented, but at the same time
there might arise conditions that would necessitate
prompt and severe measures of reprisal.
</p>
<p>
He would not like to shoot unless the object of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
his anger were at a good distance so that the
bird-shot would not severely injure the object
of his attentions.
</p>
<p>
Frank had his back against a tree, and could
observe the entire camp as he sat there with the
minutes passing. Strange noises came from the
interior of the island, but this lad had spent so
many nights under canvas that most of them
were familiar to him as the cries of owls or nighthawks,
perhaps quarreling raccoons or an opossum
objecting to a rival’s attentions to his mate.
</p>
<p>
But when he had been sitting there fully an
hour Frank’s attention was called to a slight
movement in the bushes on one side of the camp.
</p>
<p>
Thrilled with expectancy he watched the leaves,
and kept his fingers upon the triggers of the
gun that lay across his knees, ready for an
emergency.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—EXPLORING THE ISLAND</h2>
<p>
Again the bushes moved. Undoubtedly there
was some person or animal advancing in the
direction of the twin tents, with the intention
of securing a coveted article of food.
</p>
<p>
Frank never moved, only watched, and presently
he chuckled softly to himself, for he had
caught a glimpse of two yellow, glowing balls
of light that shone in the semi-darkness under
the trees like globes of phosphorus.
</p>
<p>
“Our first wildcat, come to see what sort of
fellows have invaded its territory. Well, I believe
in giving all strangers a warm reception,
and here’s to you, old chap.”
</p>
<p>
As he thought thus he gently began to elevate
his gun. The invader meanwhile had continued
to advance until its whole crouching figure was
plainly outlined.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i002' id='i002'></a>

<span class='caption'>HE DODGED JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE THE FURIOUS LEAP OF A WILDCAT.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>
The crash of the gun brought the other three
out of the tents in a mad scramble, under the
impression that either the wild man or the two
hoboes had invaded the camp.
</p>
<p>
“Where are they? Let me get a crack at the
scamps!” shouted Jerry.
</p>
<p>
There was an angry snarl, and he dodged just
in time to escape the furious leap of a wildcat
that had been crouching on some part of the
lower bluff, entirely unseen by the sentinel.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was as quick as lightning with his gun.
He whirled around and let go almost before any
of the others had discovered what object it was
he had dodged.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about that, will you,” exclaimed
the marksman, as the riddled “varmint” tried to
leap again, and fell back to breathe its last;
“where was Frank all the while—what did he
fire at, tell me?”
</p>
<p>
“This,” remarked the other, quietly, stepping
forward and picking up a monster of a bobcat
that had lain, unnoticed by Jerry, amid the leaves
still covering the ground from the previous Fall.
</p>
<p>
“Two of the critters! What do you know
about that—a pair the very first night! Well,
I reckon this old island was well named, after
all. No wonder the boys never wanted to land
here, even in the daytime. But I’d rather it was
cats than wild men, or thieving hoboes.”
</p>
<p>
After a search had failed to reveal any more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
of the “pestiferous cats,” as Jerry delighted in
calling them, the three boys crawled back under
their blankets again, for the night air felt chilly,
after being snuggled down so warmly.
</p>
<p>
No more alarms came that night, and later
on the sky cleared, allowing the moon full sway.
</p>
<p>
As daylight advanced long before Jerry’s
watch was over, it became a part of his duty to
resuscitate the fire, and begin to get ready for
breakfast.
</p>
<p>
They had laid out numerous things to be done
on this day. First of all it was decided that two
of them must hunt in company; and even those
left in camp were not to separate more than they
could help. Of course it might be necessary for
one of the stay-at-homes to launch a canoe and
try the fishing, if they expected to extend the
variety of food in the larder; but there must be
no solitary wandering about the strange island.
</p>
<p>
Frank and Jerry were chosen to make an exploration
that day. They could start in and
easily go around the island, exploring every part
of it, and learning considerable about its secrets.
</p>
<p>
If the tramps were really hiding here, possibly
some evidence of their presence would be found,
the embers of a fire it might be.
</p>
<p>
Frank was somewhat provoked about the happening
of the preceding night, and even thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
it might be advisable to move the camp away
from that bluff. The others convinced him, however,
that they were just as safe there as in any
other locality, and so he did not persist in this
idea.
</p>
<p>
He did climb to the top of the bluff to examine
the ground. Here Jerry joined him after a little.
</p>
<p>
“Any signs?” asked the latter, swinging over
to where Frank knelt.
</p>
<p>
“Plenty. Here they crouched and watched
us.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there were more than one?” asked
Jerry, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“You can see the marks of two separate pair
of shoes; and one of them small enough to belong
to your Waddy Walsh. I think you said he was
a squatty chap, and used to boast of his delicate
hands and feet,” continued Frank, pointing.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right. And that settles one thing.
The hoboes stole our kettle, and not any wild
man. I reckon they’re a little afraid of us, seeing
we’re armed, and they may not be. Wonder
what they thought we were shooting in the
night?”
</p>
<p>
“All I hope is they’ll give us a wide berth
after this. If they keep on trying to make us
feed them, it’s going to spoil our outing some,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
I fear,” remarked Frank, as he started to descend
the bluff again.
</p>
<p>
After a serious consultation the party separated.
</p>
<p>
Frank and Jerry started off along the shore,
heading to the west.
</p>
<p>
“If all goes well look for us some time before
sunset. We’ve got a lunch along and want to do
the job up brown while we’re at it, you know,”
said Frank, as he turned to wave his two comrades
farewell.
</p>
<p>
“Good luck!” called Bluff, who was washing
the dishes.
</p>
<p>
Snap!
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got you as you appear starting off on the
great exploring expedition, fellows. If by any
evil chance you never show up again, that picture
will be cherished by your relatives,” called
Will.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your croakers, will you?
That’s a pleasant send-off, now,” said Jerry, as
he fell in beside his chum, and lost sight of the
cheery camp.
</p>
<p>
They found the going rather rough at times,
and what with climbing over obstacles and cutting
a passage through creepers that trailed down
from the trees at such times as they pushed in
from the shore, progress was rather slow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
At noon they had not gone more than a third
of the way around the island.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a good place to rest. I move we sit
down, eat our grub, and take a few winks. I
didn’t get much sleep last night, and feel dopy,”
remarked Jerry.
</p>
<p>
Truth to tell, Frank was not unwilling to comply.
He was sleepy himself, and the April sun
seemed unusually warm at this time of day.
</p>
<p>
“Just as you say. That snack of crackers and
cheese and cold tongue would strike me about
right. Down it is, then,” he replied, dropping
on the green grass.
</p>
<p>
They drank from the lake when thirsty, for
the water was pure and cold. After finishing
their frugal meal the two lay back to rest. Frank
watched the clouds passing over for a time, but
finally his eyes closed and he slept.
</p>
<p>
“Here, get up!” he heard some one say close
to his ear.
</p>
<p>
Jerry was yawning and stretching. The sun
seemed to be pretty well down the first half of
the western heavens.
</p>
<p>
“How long have we been asleep here?” demanded
Jerry, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I’m ashamed to say several hours. It’s now
three,” laughed his comrade.
</p>
<p>
“Then we’d better be on the jump if we expect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
to get around the blessed old island to-day. I
won’t hear of going back after starting out with
such a grand hurrah.”
</p>
<p>
Frank was quite of the same opinion. Accordingly
the two pedestrians began to move along
their way, following the shore line save in certain
places where something out of the usual run
attracted their attention.
</p>
<p>
All the while they were on the keen watch for
any signs that would indicate the presence of
human beings on the island.
</p>
<p>
Being able to keep track of their progress by
watching the shore of the mainland, they knew
when they had reached a point half way around.
</p>
<p>
“Now we’re on the home stretch,” announced
Jerry, as he looked over the lake in the direction
of its southern terminus, not more than a quarter
of a mile off.
</p>
<p>
“But the worst is yet to come,” laughed Frank,
simply to hear Jerry groan, and not because he
really believed it to be the case.
</p>
<p>
A short time later they were tempted to enter
the depths of the timber again to investigate some
curious formation that Frank believed might be
an Indian mound.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to dig into it some time, and satisfy
my curiosity,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
“It makes a bully support for a fellow’s tired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
back, I know,” said Jerry, as he spread himself
upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Well, take a little rest, then, while I examine
that other rise over there. It looks larger than
this one, and if my suspicions prove true there
ought to be a jolly lot of relics dug out of these
mounds.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Frank, I’m agreeable. Don’t forget
me, and go back to camp alone, you know,”
said Jerry, laughing, as he stretched himself out.
</p>
<p>
“I declare if the fellow isn’t thinking of taking
another nap. Well, we may see fit to keep you
on duty the whole of to-night, so prepare yourself.”
</p>
<p>
With which warning Frank walked away. He
arrived at the larger mound, and was so deeply
interested in examining the same that the minutes
crept along unheeded. He heard the cries
of hawks quarreling in some nearby tree; then
again sounds as of small animals snarling came
from the brush beyond; but Frank paid little
heed to any of these things.
</p>
<p>
Finally he aroused himself.
</p>
<p>
“Come, this won’t do. I must get back to
Jerry, and we’ll have to do some hustling to
reach the camp by dusk,” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
When he arrived at the other mound he was
surprised not to find his chum lying there sleeping.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
Jerry had vanished in a most incomprehensible
manner!
</p>
<p>
At first, Frank thought the other might be
trying to play one of his practical jokes upon
him. He called, but there came back no answer.
</p>
<p>
Then he dropped down to examine the ground,
having been tutored by the Penobscot Indians
of the northern woods; and, finding tracks, he
knew that the worst had happened. Jerry had
undoubtedly fallen into the hands of their foes!

<p>
“Bend your head a little. Now, look pleasant,
as a fellow should after slaying a couple of
ferocious wildcats. Ready? Then here she
goes!”
</p>
<p>
Snap!
</p>
<p>
Bluff had been posing, with Jerry’s gun in
his hands. At his feet, artistically stretched out,
were the two defunct invaders of the night camp.
Will had his camera in position, and was taking
a snapshot of the mighty Nimrod.
</p>
<p>
“After all it’s only a big fake, for I never had
a hand in the killing at all,” declared Bluff, with
a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Fake? No more than most of the pictures
you see, where some well-known person is photographed
with a big bear at his feet, or perhaps
it’s a moose. I guess I know. But it gives me
a picture, and neither Jerry nor Frank would
bother posing. You’re really the only accommodating
pard in camp, Bluff,” remarked Will.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, rats! you only say that because you can
smooth me over, and get me to consent to helping
you out in these dreadful frauds of pictures.
I reckon I’ll never hear the last of it if Mame
Crosby ever learns how I stood for this, when
others claimed the game,” grunted Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“But I thank you ever so much, old fellow;
you’re so obliging,” said Will.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’d like to get one of the boats out,
and try the fish. What are you going to do,
now?” asked the other.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you. I’ve got some flashlight contrivances
here that have been used successfully,
they tell me, in making wild game photograph
themselves. Just think how great that would be.
The thing is set with a sort of trigger, you see.
As the ’coon or other beast creeps up along the
log to get the piece of meat, he crosses a string
that sets the flash afire. It’s all over in a second,
and there’s your nice picture of Mr. Coon sitting
up and looking startled.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! you believe you can do all that, do
you?” asked Bluff, the skeptic.
</p>
<p>
“Why not, when others have met with great
success. I’ve read up on the subject, and think
I’ve got it all down pat. Anyhow, no harm done
in trying.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not. Well, I’m going to leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
this gun of Jerry’s in your charge, as I’ll hardly
need it out on the lake. First I expect to dig
some worms, and then try for the perch, just
to see if they’ve wakened up from their winter’s
nap.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t go far away, I hope?” remarked
Will, a little nervously.
</p>
<p>
“See that point yonder? Well, off that I believe
the perch are waiting for me. I remember
catching a bully mess there last Spring when
several of us came down here fishing. If you
want me at any time just give a call and I’ll be
with you in a jiffy.”
</p>
<p>
So Bluff went off to dig his worms in a promising
spot, while Will began to get things in readiness
for the clever little trick he intended to play
upon B’rer ’Coon or Mr. ’Possum.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later Bluff was anchored off the
point. He found the perch ravenous, as they
usually are after a winter’s sojourn under the
ice; and it kept him busy right along pulling in
the wriggling, barred poachers, or baiting the
hooks they denuded.
</p>
<p>
It was getting along toward noon when he
fancied he detected the odor of cooking in the
air.
</p>
<p>
“Let him have a try at it; I guess it’s up to
Will to show how much he has learned in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
cooking line since last Fall. He’s a green hand,
and it’s about time he took hold. I’m comfortable
here. When grub’s ready he’ll call me,”
was what the sly Bluff was saying to himself, as
he kept his back turned toward the camp, and
continued to tempt the perch.
</p>
<p>
“Hey! you, Bluff!” came a shout just then.
</p>
<p>
“What d’ye want, bothering me in that way?”
demanded the fisherman.
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake come ashore and give me
a hand. I can’t find any more dishes, and the
pesky thing still keeps bubbling over. Come
quick, or we’ll be smothered under a mountain
of it!” shouted the one on shore.
</p>
<p>
“Now what under the sun has the fellow been
up to?” said Bluff to himself, as he pulled in his
anchor, and used the paddle to urge the canoe
ashore.
</p>
<p>
When he strode into the camp a minute or so
later he stared, and then burst into a shout of
laughter as he dropped upon the ground and
rolled about.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t see anything so funny about it,”
declared Will, in an aggrieved tone as he looked
at the various kettles and dishes heaped high
with boiled rice, and the kettle on the fire still
pouring up its white contents like a miniature
volcano in action. “I never knew rice would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
expand like that. Why, it’s dreadful the way
it keeps boiling over. What can we do to hold
the stuff?”
</p>
<p>
“Say, how much did you put in the kettle?”
gasped Bluff, when he could speak.
</p>
<p>
“All there was, and even then I wondered if
there would be any left for the rest.”
</p>
<p>
Bluff acted as though he would have a fit.
</p>
<p>
“All there was,” he shouted, “that beats anything
I ever heard. And Frank said the grocery-man
had doubled his order, and put up <em>four
pounds</em>! Say, we’ll have rice every way under
the sun up to the day we pull up stakes and get
out of here. Still she boils! If you don’t take
care the blooming thing’ll put the fire out.”
</p>
<p>
Finally he condescended to help poor Will,
and some of the rice was scooped out of the kettle,
relieving the congestion. Still, what to do with
the vast quantity of half-cooked rice was a question
calculated to appall Will during the balance
of the day.
</p>
<p>
He finally compromised by secretly burying a
large portion where he calculated none of his
chums would find it again.
</p>
<p>
Bluff assisted in getting some lunch ready, and
Will was very meek after that experience. He
grimly determined that he would pay more attention
to what the others were doing when preparing meals,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
and by degrees learn the secret of
cooking.
</p>
<p>
“Did you get your little game trap set?” asked
Bluff after they had eaten, and lay around taking
it easy.
</p>
<p>
“Everything is ready for the coming of the
night. I’ll expect to find the cheap little camera
which I brought along for that especial purpose,
doing its work. No matter, it’s worth a trial,
anyway. Nothing ventured, nothing gained,”
remarked Will.
</p>
<p>
“Rice, for instance,” ventured Bluff, turning
his head to look at the great snow-white heap
that covered a spread-out newspaper nearby, since
they had to empty the cooking utensils which
Will had filled one after the other.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I admit that was a fine joke on me, all
right, and I suppose I’ll have to just stand the
digs of the boys for a while. But it’s spurred
me on, and sooner or later I’m bound to be a
<em>chef</em> worth mentioning. I guess they haven’t
found any sort of game on their trip around the
island, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I heard no shot to tell of it,” admitted Bluff.
He was lying on his back and apparently ready
for a nap.
</p>
<p>
“It was some hot out there on the water, son,
and I’m inclined to be dopy. Please keep on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
guard while I take a dozen winks,” he said, pulling
his hat over his face.
</p>
<p>
His dozen winks stretched out for some two
hours. During this time Will busied himself in
reading a little book on camp cookery which he
had brought along. It looked as though he were
about to study up on the subject in earnest.
</p>
<p>
Finally Bluff gave a grunt, began to move
and stretch himself, and then sat up.
</p>
<p>
“Hello! I guess I must have been asleep,”
he remarked.
</p>
<p>
Will drew out his little nickel watch and surveyed
it.
</p>
<p>
“Two hours and thirteen minutes to the dot.
A few winks, eh? When am I going to get my
chance to indulge?” he demanded, sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Now, if the spirit moves. But I see you have
been busy ‘conning’ that volume of camp recipes.
Any dishes that call for rice there, because we’ve
got it and to spare. I always liked boiled rice,
with sugar and milk, even the condensed kind;
but there can be too much of a good thing. I’ll
be like the old dominie soon whose people fed
him on rabbit every place he went.”
</p>
<p>
“How was that?” asked Will.
</p>
<p>
“Never heard that story? Well, you see, they
knew he liked rabbit, so every place he ate, his
host made sure to have his favorite dish. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
course the good man hated to tell them that he
was getting sick of the taste of rabbit; so what
d’ye think he finally hit on as a delicate way of
getting a change?”
</p>
<p>
“I give it up; now tell me,” declared Will.
</p>
<p>
“When he found it before him the next time
he bowed his head and this was the grace he
said: ‘Of rabbits young, of rabbits old; of rabbits
hot, of rabbits cold; of rabbits tender and
rabbits tough, I thank the Lord we’ve had
enough!’”
</p>
<p>
“That must have fetched them, all right. Now,
if any one puts up a howl here about rice, I’m
going to bury the balance of it, mark my words.
What ails you, Bluff?” demanded Will, as his
companion started half to his knees, and crouching
there stared through the leaves of the low-growing
trees that concealed the camp from the
lake.
</p>
<p>
“Look yonder, and see! H’sh! not another
word!” he murmured.
</p>
<p>
Will crept to a place beside him, and, finding
an opening, also used his eyes to advantage.
What he saw would have annoyed any of the
boys, considering the fact that they had hoped
for a period of peace while camping on Wildcat
Island.
</p>
<p>
A large rowboat was just passing that side of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
the island. It had come from up the lake somewhere,
and was filled with a crowd of rough-looking
boys.
</p>
<p>
“Pet Peters and his crowd again. They gave
us all the trouble they could last Fall when we
were in camp above the lumber docks, and now
they’ve hunted us up again to annoy us,” breathed
Will, as soon as he saw who occupied the rowboat.
“But Andy Lasher isn’t with them—he’s
away on a visit, somebody told me.”
</p>
<p>
Bluff had reached out and picked up Jerry’s
shotgun.
</p>
<p>
“They seem to be looking in here pretty hard,”
continued Will.
</p>
<p>
“I guess they know we’re here, and they’ve
got some mean trick up their sleeve; but possession’s
nine points of the law, and we don’t get
out to please those rowdies,” said Bluff between
set teeth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—GUARDIANS OF THE CAMP</h2>
<p>
“Do you believe they mean to land here?”
asked Will, his voice trembling a bit.
</p>
<p>
“I did; but it looks as if they’ve thought better
of it, for now the old boat’s moving on. They’ll
land, all right, and try some game on us to-night,
likely,” answered the other, who had pushed the
gun forward as if meaning to make use of it
should the necessity arise.
</p>
<p>
Bluff was a reckless fellow at times, and inclined
to be fiery, though, like most of his kind,
his temper was quickly subdued, and he easily
became repentant.
</p>
<p>
“But perhaps they’re only down here for a
row; or, it may happen that they mean to get a
mess of those fine perch,” suggested Will.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps, but all the same, I saw that old tent
of theirs sticking up in the bow of the boat,” declared
Bluff, positively.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! then that settles it. Well, it looks as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
though we might have a lively enough time of it,
after all. What with the wild man, those two
thievish tramps, the wildcats that live on the
island, and now, last but not least, the Pet Peters
crowd that used to train with Andy Lasher.
Can we ever go anywhere and be let alone?”
complained Will, who loved peace above all
things.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t mind it much. We came out
for some excitement, and it looks as if we were
going to get our fill,” said Bluff, who was built
more upon the adventurous model than his companion.
</p>
<p>
They watched the boat as long as it remained
in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Seemed to me they were heading in for the
shore just before they disappeared,” suggested
Bluff, finally, as he turned and looked at his mate.
</p>
<p>
“I admit that it looked that way to me. Then
we might as well take it for granted that
they’re going to make camp on the island. I
wonder——” mused Will, fingering his pet
camera reflectively.
</p>
<p>
“What now?” demanded the other suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
“The idea struck me that perhaps I might creep
close enough to their camp to get a snapshot.
You know those I have of that crowd are in
sections, either running away, or doing some sort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
of stunt. I’d like to have one that showed them
up seated around their fire, and planning mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll do nothing of the sort, my lad, at
least not while I’m left in charge of the camp.
What sort of fellow are you, anyway? You
profess to be afraid of the crazy man that is
said to be on this island, and you know those
brutes yonder would be only too glad to beat
you up if you fell into their hands; yet you propose
spying on them without a thought of the
danger.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! but that was to get a picture, you see,”
explained Will, as though such a laudable motive
might be sufficient to make any one valiant.
</p>
<p>
Bluff looked at him, and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll sure have you over in that sanitarium
at Merrick, before long, for you show all the
signs of getting looney. I tell you what I’m going
to do,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, go on. You’re hardly complimentary,
you know; but I consider the source.”
</p>
<p>
“While you remain here, I’m going to climb up
to the top of this bluff. Perhaps I can get a sight
of their landing-place. It may even be that I
shall discover signs of our two pards making
their weary way around the end of the island,
yonder.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“And if there is a good chance for a view,
call me up with my camera, will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. You settle down here. I’ll take the
gun along. I can defend the camp just as well
up there as below. Don’t worry about that, my
boy.”
</p>
<p>
And Bluff started off.
</p>
<p>
When he reached the top of the abrupt rise
he did have a splendid view of the lake and the
distant shore, but could see little of the island.
</p>
<p>
“No good for taking pictures, pard. Just you
stay down there, and I’ll join you after I’ve
looked through my marine glasses a little,” he
called down.
</p>
<p>
Frank had brought along a good pair of
glasses belonging to his father; and with these
Bluff now scanned the shore line as far as he
could see it. He was in hopes of discovering
some sign of the two explorers around the point;
or possibly locating the camp of the Peters
crowd.
</p>
<p>
The big rowboat he did see on the beach, and
there were signs of smoke among the trees close
by, so that he decided where the town bully and
his followers had taken up their temporary
quarters.
</p>
<p>
“Wonder if they dare attack us in the night?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
was what Bluff was saying to himself as he once
more commenced to descend the bluff.
</p>
<p>
His mind went back to their previous experiences
with these same boys. The rowdies had
tried to burn their camp; they had stolen whatever
they could lay hands on, and made themselves
disagreeable until the conversion of their
leader, at that time Andy Lasher, by Jerry, who
had saved his life when he was caught under a
fallen tree, had changed the complexion of
things.
</p>
<p>
Under the rule of the new leader, Pet Peters,
these fellows would be equal to any deed of misconduct
just so far as they dared. The fact that
the four chums never went into camp without
guns of some sort might make them cautious;
but that would be the only thing.
</p>
<p>
Will bombarded him with questions when he
came down.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see Frank and Jerry?—was the camp
of those fellows in sight?—could I get any sort
of picture, if I climbed up?” so he went on until
Bluff called a halt.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing doing at all. Just stay here where
you’re well off. We’ve got our hands full to
guard this camp. I’m wondering what keeps
the boys so long, that’s all,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But the minutes lengthened into hours and still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
there were no signs of the explorers. Bluff and
Will started to get supper ready. Neither of
them felt very gay, for a shadow seemed to be
resting upon the camp.
</p>
<p>
The sun had set behind the mountains in the
west, and with the gathering of the dusk their
fears increased.
</p>
<p>
“Something dreadful must have happened to
them,” said Will, looking alarmed.
</p>
<p>
Bluff tried to laugh it off, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Humbug! What could happen to those two
chaps? They’re up in all that pertains to the
forest, and they’ve got a gun along, too. It’s
you and I that may well be called the babes in
the woods. We know precious little between us;
but you just bet nobody can give us points on
how to cook rice.”
</p>
<p>
But Will was too much worried to even show
signs of anger or reproach.
</p>
<p>
“What if they don’t come at all? What if
both fellows disappear mysteriously as if they
were swallowed up in the earth? We’ll feel
pretty tough telling their parents the sad news.
I kind of wish now we hadn’t come,” he remarked
dolefully.
</p>
<p>
“Just let up on that tune, will you? Think of
the pictures you have already secured, and the
others coming. Why, the boys might have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
delayed by a dozen things. Make up your mind
they’re all right and will pop in on us at any
minute.”
</p>
<p>
But despite Bluff’s attempt to cheer his mate
up, Will kept watching the bushes in the light of
the rousing fire they kept going, as if hoping
against hope that his prediction of evil might
not be fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
They waited until the supper began to get cold.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to eat by ourselves, I reckon, partner.
Those other chaps have given us the cold
shake for just now. But they’ll be along after
awhile, never fear,” said Bluff, putting on a bold
face, even while his heart was troubled.
</p>
<p>
Will was seriously alarmed, but he tried not
to show it, out of pride. So there the two poor
fellows sat as the time passed, trying to assume
a nonchalance that neither of them really felt.
</p>
<p>
Twice they started up as some sound arose
to startle them. Once it was a shrill cry from the
neighboring woods, and Bluff laughed to recognize
the solemn “whoo-whoo” of an owl; the
other time it was some equally harmless source
from which the alarming sound sprung.
</p>
<p>
The idea of spending the night by themselves
was far from pleasant. Neither of them wanted
to sit up, and yet they dared not lie down and
try to sleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“This isn’t so very much fun,” grumbled Bluff,
as he held on to the gun and continued to stare
about him at the changing shadows that seemed
to flutter around the outskirts of the camp.
</p>
<p>
It had been a question of dispute between them
as to whether they should keep up a good fire or
allow it to dwindle down. Will was for having
a roaring blaze that would serve to warn all evildoers
and trespassers that they were awake and
on the watch. On his part Bluff declared it would
draw trouble; so they compromised by allowing
the fire to die partly down.
</p>
<p>
“Say, it must be getting awful late,” remarked
Will, stifling a yawn.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you lie down and get some sleep,
then?” expostulated the other; “I’ll stand guard,
and nothing is going to happen.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, but you see I know I couldn’t
sleep a wink thinking about those two poor fellows,
and wondering what has happened. Do
you suppose they could be drowned, Bluff?”
asked Will, in an awe-struck voice.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, get out with your gloomy ideas.
Drowned—those fellows drowned—not on your
life. They have some good reason for not showing
up. I don’t know what it is, but you’ll see
when they do come. Don’t get timid, Will.”
</p>
<p>
“Timid! Who’s showing the white feather,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
I’d like to know. Why, I’m not afraid of anything
that could happen here. You never saw
me shake unless it was with the cold. What is
there to fear, after all? Just lie down if you feel
like it, and—— What’s that?”
</p>
<p>
Will gave vent to a half-muffled yell when a
sudden vivid flash dispelled the darkness around
them, as if lightning had cut the gloom of night.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—FRANK TRIES TO FIGURE IT OUT</h2>
<p>
Frank was sorely perplexed. He felt sure
that Jerry must have fallen into the hands of
some enemies while he was busily engaged in
examining the second Indian mound. Perhaps
it might be that he had even heard the low cry
of his chum when the others seized upon him, but
in his ignorance had supposed it to be the call of
a bird in the brush.
</p>
<p>
He tried to read the signs the best he could.
</p>
<p>
“There’s that same small footprint, showing
that the two tramps have been here. Were they
watching for us, or did we just happen to drop
in upon some favorite hiding-place of theirs?
They saw a chance to get my pard while I was
away with the gun. And now what will they do
with him?”
</p>
<p>
So he pondered as he stood there looking
around at the dense foliage that gave no hint
as to where these lawless characters could have
taken poor Jerry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank searched high and low as the minutes
passed, but without any success. He saw the
coming of night with uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
“This is a nice pickle for me. Trying to warn
the others, and I fall into the pit myself the first
one. But they wouldn’t dare hurt Jerry. We
haven’t done them any harm. What they really
want, I imagine, consists of our guns and food.
Then they could hold out for a long campaign
in the woods, and snap their fingers at the sheriff
and his posse. Like as not, in the morning they’ll
try to open communications with us and offer
Jerry in exchange for our things.”
</p>
<p>
The thought gave him pain. Never before had
he known just how much he thought of the missing
boy.
</p>
<p>
Then he remembered that he had two other
chums.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll be worried too. Perhaps I’d better be
getting back to camp to relieve their distress of
mind. It will be all right in the morning, no
doubt. And there’s always a chance that Jerry
may be able to give the rascals the slip. He can
duck first-class when he wants to, whether it’s
playing hockey or prisoner’s base.”
</p>
<p>
Getting what small consolation he could out
of this, Frank now set about heading for the
camp. He had ventured far into the interior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
of the island, and only for the fact that the stars
were shining brightly above, he might have
further mixed matters up by getting thoroughly
lost himself.
</p>
<p>
There were times when he found it all he could
do to push his way through the dense vegetation
which obstructed his passage on every side.
</p>
<p>
But having taken his bearings, he knew he
was slowly but surely drawing nearer the point
where their camp lay. The bluff stood up against
the star-bedecked sky at such times as he found
a clear spot and could catch a view.
</p>
<p>
Frank happened to have an unusually large
supply of matches with him. He always carried
some when in the woods, but that morning he had
taken up quite a bunch from the receptacle Jerry
had made to hold them near the entrance to their
tent.
</p>
<p>
Consequently he was able to strike one every
little while when some peculiarly knotty problem
presented itself for solution.
</p>
<p>
It was while standing in a little glade that he
ignited one of the matches in order to glance
at his watch, more than anything else. His attention
was immediately attracted toward something
on the ground.
</p>
<p>
“The ashes of a fire, without a doubt. That
proves the presence of human beings on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
island; and I guess an escaped lunatic would
never be guilty of making a fire. Oh! those two
hoboes are here, all right. If I could only get
word to Mr. Dodd now, he would surround the
island, and capture them easily. But if they
hurt my chum they’ll pay dear for it,” he
muttered.
</p>
<p>
The ashes were stone cold, as he discovered
upon placing his hand upon them, Indian style.
Perhaps a red native of the North Woods could
have even told just how long it had been since
fire lingered among the dead embers; but it was
more than the boy was able to do.
</p>
<p>
Again he pushed forward. Rounding the
bluff, he now headed straight for the camp.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps he found himself entertaining a desolate
hope that, after all, Jerry might have played
a little trick on him, running off, and making
camp while he lingered. Frank knew about the
old game of “holding the bag,” where boys coax
a green comrade to go out into the dark woods
far from home, and leave him holding a sack over
the end of a hollow log while they pretend to
scare up the rabbits or other game, but in reality
go home; but he did not think Jerry would play
such a lark when things looked so serious around
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
He wondered why he did not see something of
the fire.
</p>
<p>
Surely nothing could have happened to the two
in camp? That would be worse and worse, for
it was bad enough to think of Jerry in the hands
of those rascally hoboes, without adding to the
horror.
</p>
<p>
Now he was crawling up near the place under
the shelter of the bluff, craning his neck eagerly
for some sign of the boys. At first he could not
see them. The fire was burning low, and that
was a sign he did not like.
</p>
<p>
Frank began to feel a cold sensation creep over
him. It was beginning to seem so sinister and
awe-inspiring that he was deeply impressed.
</p>
<p>
Then he caught the low buzz of voices, and,
listening, was cheered to recognize the tones of
Will as he made his boast.
</p>
<p>
When that sudden amazing flash came, Frank
crouched there as if transformed into a pillar of
salt, like Lot’s wife. For the life of him he could
not understand what had happened. He thought
he heard a scuffling sound on the other side of the
camp, but was not sure. Then Will spoke up,
his voice quivering with alarm:
</p>
<p>
“Oh! what was that, Bluff? Did any one
shoot, or was it lightning? I didn’t hear the
thunder, did you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hang the luck, that gave me a bad start, as
sure as you live. And to think, after all, it was
only that beastly old flash you arranged to make
some animal take a photograph of himself!
A few times like that and we’ll both be fit to go
over to the Merrick Asylum, that’s what.”
</p>
<p>
“My camera set for a flashlight picture? Why,
of course! How silly for me to be startled! But
I should have remembered it in a few seconds,
anyhow. Thank you for reminding me of it.
And it worked, you notice, Bluff. You laughed
at the idea, but I guess I’ve got the ’coon’s picture,
all right,” laughed Will, hysterically.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that over on the other side, yonder?
I would swear I saw something moving there.
Listen, and tell me if you can hear him breathing
before I let go!” exclaimed Bluff, excitedly.
</p>
<p>
“Hold on there, Bluff, don’t you dare fire!
It’s me, and I’m hiding behind this tree for fear
of being punctured by a load of shot!” called a
voice.
</p>
<p>
Will gave vent to a gurgle of delight, and
seemed to try to hug himself.
</p>
<p>
“Thank goodness, it’s Frank. They’ve returned
at last to a cold supper. Welcome home,
boys. We’ve been looking for you this long
while,” he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, he’s alone!” exclaimed Bluff, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I’ve got some bad news for you,
fellows,” said Frank, coming up.
</p>
<p>
“About Jerry?” demanded Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he’s gone!” continued the newcomer,
dejectedly.
</p>
<p>
“Gone!” echoed Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Goodness gracious! what’s happened?” ejaculated
Will, clutching hold of the newcomer’s
sleeve, as though his knees suddenly grew weak.
</p>
<p>
“Disappeared, and I’m seriously afraid that
those miserable hoboes have caught him,” declared
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Caught him—but they’re not cannibals—they
couldn’t eat poor Jerry!” came from the bewildered
Will, at which Bluff gave a contemptuous
laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course not, silly. Frank means
they’ve caught Jerry, intending to make him
valuable some way; ain’t that it, Frank?” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I mean. They may try to dicker
with us for some provisions. I rather guess
they’re some shy in that line. Or, it may be they
want us to clear out. Any way you fix it the
thing has a bad look, and promises to break up
our pleasant little outing.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a beastly shame. I’d just like to get hold
of those tramps. Wouldn’t they be headed for
the lock-up in Centerville in a hurry!” growled
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
Frank looked at him seriously as if contemplating
some move.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said he presently, “I don’t know but
what it will come to it that you can have a hand
in their removal.”
</p>
<p>
“What d’ye mean?” demanded the other, instantly.
</p>
<p>
“It may be that between now and morning I’ll
ask you to make a little journey.”
</p>
<p>
“Looking up the hoboes?” asked Will, aghast.
</p>
<p>
“Well, hardly. This trip would be by water,
and in a canoe,” replied Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I catch on, all right. You think some
one ought to go back to town and let the sheriff
know that his game can be found here on Wildcat
Island?” said Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Just so, but please lower your voice; there’s
no telling who may be hiding in the bushes
around here. Those hoboes want something
we’ve got, and they mean to have it if possible.
Perhaps it may be food, and, again, I’ve thought,
they may envy us the possession of guns.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think the idea is a good one; somebody
ought to go,” pursued Bluff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then it ought to be you. Who can paddle a
canoe better than you, Bluff? Besides, Frank
is needed here on the island. Something might
come up that neither you nor I could settle,”
remarked Will.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so. Let me know what you decide,
Frank, and you’ll find me willing,” continued
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
For answer the other simply squeezed his hand.
He was considerably worried over the mysterious
absence of Jerry, and realized that the game they
were playing was a much more serious one than
any that had as yet claimed their attention. These
disreputable rascals were desperate; they had
done something calculated to send them to the
penitentiary for a term of years, and would try
their best to avoid punishment.
</p>
<p>
“There’s one thing good, Bluff, if you do go:
you won’t have to paddle along in the dark,”
said Will, presently.
</p>
<p>
The others glanced toward the east, where the
light of the moon was just beginning to appear
along the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Even as they stood there and talked in low
tones the silvery face of the moon pushed up
into view. Being some days past her full, she
was shorn of a portion of her circuit; but still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
promised a flood of light during the balance of
the night.
</p>
<p>
Somehow even this circumstance seemed to
give the boys new encouragement.
</p>
<p>
“Things never look quite so bad when you
can see what’s what,” was Will’s way of mentioning
this circumstance.
</p>
<p>
“Suppose you come and sit down, Frank. Both
of us are just dying to hear all about what happened
to you and Jerry,” said Bluff, presently.
</p>
<p>
“There’s precious little to tell, but what there
is you shall hear, boys. I’m ashamed to say that
it was while I was a little ways off, examining
some curious mounds, made perhaps by the old
Indians, that this thing happened to our chum.
But let’s sit down here, and I’ll tell you all about
it.”
</p>
<p>
In a low tone he started to detail the few
things that had marked the circuitous journey of
himself and Jerry, while the others hung upon
every word, anxious to hear the thrilling dénouement
where he found the comrade who had
shared his adventures, missing.
</p>
<p>
Just as he reached this point, and they were
all worked up over it, Bluff gave a sudden jump.
On the spur of the moment Frank supposed he
had become so nervous over the description that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
he could no longer sit still. He was therefore
astounded to hear his chum cry out:
</p>
<p>
“Looky there, boys! As sure as you live, some
miserable reptile is getting away with the canoe
I used in fishing, and left pulled up on the beach!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—RECOVERING A STOLEN BOAT</h2>
<p>
“After him!” exclaimed Frank, as he also
sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Stop the scoundrel!” echoed Will, a bit slower
at getting in motion.
</p>
<p>
Of course Frank never once dreamed that it
could be any other than one of the two hoboes.
They needed various things, and a boat might
be among the number, although evidently they
must have had a craft of some sort in order to
reach the island in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
The moon was half hidden among a few floating
clouds that hung close to the horizon, but
gave plenty of light for them to see what was
going on. The bold thief must have been prowling
around in the vicinity of the camp, trying to
get a chance to make way with something.
</p>
<p>
Even as they looked he was shoving the canoe
in the water. Then he tumbled into it rather
awkwardly, which was a pretty good sign that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
knew little about balancing in one of the cranky
little craft.
</p>
<p>
“Where are the other boats—get the key to
unlock them!” exclaimed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got it right here—this way, fellows!”
echoed Bluff.
</p>
<p>
He was already bending over the bunch of
boats consisting of the mate to the stolen craft
and the big double canoe.
</p>
<p>
Frank snatched up a paddle and bounded over
to where his comrades knelt. As soon as Bluff
threw the chain aside the other snatched up the
single canoe, rushed straight to the water’s edge
and launched it. All this had taken but a comparatively
few seconds to transpire. Indeed, the
thief was not fifty feet away at the time Frank
threw himself into the other craft.
</p>
<p>
Bluff and Will drew up on the edge of the
water.
</p>
<p>
“Mind the camp! Get the guns secure! This
may be a clever trick to draw attention away
from the tents! I’ll take care of the thief,
fellows!”
</p>
<p>
Frank’s voice boomed over the lake. Already
he was sending his paddle deep into the water,
and urging his frail craft onward with constantly
increasing speed.
</p>
<p>
“He’s right. We must guard the camp! This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
way, Will—pick up Frank’s gun, and keep watch.
We can have one eye on the lake and the other
here!” called Bluff, who was quick to catch on
to a thing once he heard it.
</p>
<p>
So they stood there on the border, each making
quick turns of the head in order to see all that
went on.
</p>
<p>
If any thief entered that camp just then, calculating
on having a clear field for his operations,
he was likely to soon regret his temerity, for the
boys were tremendously aroused, and Bluff had
an impetuous nature.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Frank was pushing onward with
furious zeal.
</p>
<p>
He could see that he was gaining with every
stroke. The occupant of the other canoe seemed
to be paddling desperately, but he evidently did
not know just how to get the best results from
his labor. His craft wobbled considerably; that
is, it headed from one side to the other.
</p>
<p>
As a result Frank was rapidly overcoming the
distance that had in the start separated him from
the unknown.
</p>
<p>
He anticipated that at the last the other would
try and turn to the shore with the idea of making
a hurried landing. In order to cut him off
from such safety Frank kept in-shore, where he
could interpose should the enemy try that game.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got him!” was what he was saying to
himself, over and over.
</p>
<p>
The thought gave the boy a fierce satisfaction.
He now began to wonder just how he was
going to recover the boat. Would the rascal
dive overboard at the last, or put up a desperate
fight to retain possession of his prize?
</p>
<p>
Frank held to the belief that it was one of the
hoboes. That meant he would find himself opposed
to a man accustomed to defying the law and
ready to commit even a crime in order to retain
his liberty.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a coward, anyhow, or he wouldn’t run
that way,” he assured himself, as he worked
harder than ever at the paddle.
</p>
<p>
Now he was close upon the other. Too late
the thief tried to head shoreward, and escape in
that way. Frank saw his opportunity to cut
him off; and again the race started straightaway
over the moonlit lake.
</p>
<p>
Those on the shore at the camp could no
longer see the rival canoes. The moonlight was
deceptive; and, besides, the fiercely paddling
twain had turned the point.
</p>
<p>
But a new light of a fire had dawned upon
the vision of Frank, which he knew came from
the camp of the Peters crowd; for the boys had,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
of course, told him about the arrival of these
rough customers on the island.
</p>
<p>
“I declare, I believe it must be one of that lot,
and not the tramp after all,” he muttered, as he
again cut the other off from heading ashore.
</p>
<p>
This put a new face on matters.
</p>
<p>
He no longer hesitated about coming to conclusions
with the thief. If, after all, it was but
a boy like himself, he could not meet him any too
soon to satisfy his desires.
</p>
<p>
Observing the fellow’s manner more closely
now, he was not long in determining upon his
identity.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Pet Peters himself. And he’s getting
worried to know just what he’s going to do to
save himself and the stolen canoe, too. I’d better
end this agony with a rush, and here goes!”
</p>
<p>
So saying, he now headed directly for the
other craft, rushing forward with furious speed
that gave the finishing touch to the alarm of the
pursued one.
</p>
<p>
In vain had Pet tried to outwit him; he had
been caught every time, and forced to keep in
the open. Even when he attempted to hold his
own straight ahead it was to see the distance
cut down steadily.
</p>
<p>
Before now he had tried conclusions with
Frank Langdon, nor was he hankering after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
repetition of his previous experiences. The
memory of sundry bruises had never entirely left
him; and it looked as though the other might
be more angry on this occasion than ever before.
</p>
<p>
“Hold up there, you thief! I’ve got you
cornered!” called Frank, as he pushed still nearer.
</p>
<p>
Pet ceased paddling. After all it was just as
well, for he had lost hope of evading this persistent
pursuer in the race.
</p>
<p>
He clutched his spruce paddle fiercely in his
hands. If it came to the worst he could perhaps
use the same as a weapon of defense. It had
failed him in its legitimate channels, but could
he give the other one smart blow on the head with
its edge, no doubt Frank must be put out of the
running.
</p>
<p>
And Pet Peters had no scruples on the score of
delicacy. He was accustomed to rough methods
of carrying his point. A blow on the head usually
concluded any argument in which he might be
engaged.
</p>
<p>
“Keep back, you!” he yelled.
</p>
<p>
Frank saw that he was now standing rather
unsteadily in the canoe. He smiled grimly, for
he knew that the game was in his hands. Any
fellow who is so foolish as to stand upright in
so frail a vessel places himself in a position where
he is apt to receive a sudden and unexpected bath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
Frank was still advancing in a line as though
he calculated to come alongside the other boat.
That was evidently just what the bully expected
him to do, and to meet which anticipated emergency
he was now, as he thought, fully prepared.
</p>
<p>
“Get out of that boat, and in a hurry, you!”
cried Frank.
</p>
<p>
He was speaking more to hold the attention
of Pet than because he expected the other to
obey him.
</p>
<p>
“Keep back, I tell yuh, Langdon, er it’ll be the
worse for yuh!” bellowed the other, at the same
time making several vicious sweeps through the
air with his poised paddle, as if to emphasize his
pugnacious intentions.
</p>
<p>
The act came very nearly being his undoing,
for he staggered and had to even make a quick
clutch at the gunwale of the canoe to keep his
balance.
</p>
<p>
Frank saw his chance. He was by this time
close enough to put his little scheme into practice.
That canoe had to be recovered one way
or another. If Pet refused to surrender his ill-gotten
plunder peaceably, then it was high time
other measures were brought into play.
</p>
<p>
With a sudden turn Frank headed his boat
straight at the side of the other. He meant at
the last instant to turn far enough to give but a
slanting blow, not desiring to injure the second
canoe by smashing in the delicate ribs.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='caption'>PET PETERS TOOK A HEADLONG PLUNGE OVER THE SIDE.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>
Too late did Pet realize how completely he
had placed himself in the power of his more expert
adversary, who had handled canoes so long
that he was perfectly at home in one.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you, keep away!”
</p>
<p>
It was the despairing wail of a quitter. Even
before the prow of Frank’s craft was in collision
with the side of his own, Pet knew that he was
about to experience a tremendous shock against
which he would be given no chance to prepare
himself.
</p>
<p>
In his sudden terror his first act was to let
fall the paddle which he had intended to use in
knocking Frank out. Then he tried to get hold
of both gunwales, so as to brace himself against
the shock.
</p>
<p>
It was too late, however. A second more and
he might have done something, but by that little
space of time he lost.
</p>
<p>
Bang! came the stem of Frank’s canoe against
the second boat, which was tilted half way over
under the impact. Pet Peters took a headlong
plunge over the side and disappeared under the
moonlit waters of the lake with a tremendous
splash!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—DOWN THE SLOPE</h2>
<p>
Frank laughed. He really could not help it,
the sight of Pet going overboard with such a
great tossing of arms and legs was so comical.
But at the same time he did not forget to reach
over and reclaim the floating paddle.
</p>
<p>
He was already holding on to the recovered
boat, when, with a great splurge and splashing,
Pet appeared on the surface of the water, swimming
as well as his clothes would permit. Fortunately
the fellow was a regular water-dog, and
able to easily sustain himself under any circumstances
when in the lake; though doubtless he
found his bath rather cold at this early season of
the year.
</p>
<p>
“Think yuh done sumpin smart, I reckon,
Langdon! I’ll get even with yuh for it, see if I
don’t!” he snorted, sustaining himself by vigorous
strokes.
</p>
<p>
“Better get ashore before your clothes drag you
down. Do your blowing afterwards, Peters.
You’re a thief, that’s all, and ought to be landed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
behind the bars for such work as this. Go on,
now, before I get real mad and chase you ashore.”
</p>
<p>
Possibly the fellow feared that Frank might
take a notion to do as he threatened, for he had
a healthy respect concerning the other’s prowess.
At any rate he started to swim away with lusty
strokes. One might have thought a bear was
in the water, such was the noise he made.
</p>
<p>
Frank found the painter of the recovered
canoe. This he fastened to a cleat, and then,
making a turn, headed back to the camp.
</p>
<p>
Those who were anxiously listening caught a
glimpse of the two boats as they turned the point.
</p>
<p>
“He’s got it back all right!” cried Will, in
excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Bully for Frank! He’s equal to the whole
Peters crowd!” called Bluff; from which it could
easily be understood that neither of these boys
had been in any doubt as to whom they had to
thank for the stealing of the boat.
</p>
<p>
Frank landed in a few minutes. Beyond
breathing a little harder than usual he showed no
signs of his recent chase.
</p>
<p>
“This time we’ll make sure that all the boats
are fast. It was a bad break for you to leave
that one loose. But we have had so many strange
things happen since we landed on Wildcat Island
that a fellow can hardly be blamed for letting a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
cog slip occasionally. Lend a hand, Bluff,” said
Frank.
</p>
<p>
That was his way. He realized that no one
could be perfect, that he sometimes made mistakes
himself, and others should be forgiven if
they occasionally neglected to do the things that
were expected of them.
</p>
<p>
And that was the secret of why the other fellows
all admired Frank above any of their companions:
he could forgive another’s fault, but
was very severe with himself when he happened
to fall short.
</p>
<p>
They secured the boats and carried the paddles
into camp.
</p>
<p>
Will seemed inconsolable. He had heard that
tremendous splash, and already understood what
had caused it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! if I could only have caught that fellow
just in the act of taking that header, what a
beaut it would have been. Too bad that such
glorious chances escape me all the time,” he
moaned.
</p>
<p>
But the others had too serious a problem to
consider to pay much attention to the complaints
of the amateur photographer.
</p>
<p>
“How about going to Centerville?” asked
Bluff, as they sat there near the revived camp
fire to talk it over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“That can wait a while. Plenty of time between
now and morning, Bluff,” answered the
one addressed, as he poked the fire reflectively.
</p>
<p>
“But you’ve got something on your mind,”
argued Bluff, shrewdly.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think that?” demanded
Frank, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“I can see it in your eyes; they give you away.
So let’s hear what it is, for you see we’re all
equally interested,” replied his chum, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, of course it’s about Jerry,” began
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“That goes without saying. You’re not thinking
of starting out in the night to make another
hunt for him, are you?” demanded Will, arousing
to the fact that perhaps he might be left alone
in camp, and under the circumstances he would
not enjoy that very much.
</p>
<p>
“Somehow a new idea has flashed into my
head. I don’t know that there is anything to it,
but somehow I’m unable to dismiss it. The fact
of Pet Peters being bold enough to sneak up
here and try to make way with one of our canoes
gave me this thought,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Go on, please,” urged Will, while Bluff
awaited the disclosure with equal anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps those fellows are responsible for
Jerry’s disappearance!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“What! the Peters crowd? Strange that none
of us thought of that before,” declared Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Then you agree with me that there is a chance
that way?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t put it past them a minute,” replied
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“But what would they want with him? They’re
not so desperate as the hoboes, and, besides,
you remember that Mr. Dodd warned them he
meant to run the lot in if they kept pestering
us,” ventured Will.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! that was away last Fall. Those fellows
have forgotten all about that by this time. Frank,
I’m inclined to agree with you. In that case,
what had we better do? Take the guns and make
a sudden attack on their camp?”
</p>
<p>
Bluff, always ready for trouble, reached out
his hand toward Jerry’s gun as he spoke, showing
his willingness to follow up his suggestion by
immediate action.
</p>
<p>
“Not so fast, my hearty. If we attacked their
camp and then found that they had nothing to
do with Jerry’s kidnapping we’d be in a nice
pickle, wouldn’t we? After that they could say
we were a lot of savages, as well as they.”
</p>
<p>
“But something should be done!” expostulated
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“And I propose to do it. In other words I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
mean to take a little stroll around the point, and
see what their camp looks like,” remarked Frank,
rising.
</p>
<p>
“If you find they’ve got our chum, promise to
come back for us. We want to have a hand in
bringing about his release. You will, won’t you,
Frank?” asked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“I promise you, boys. Keep Jerry’s gun with
you, and stay on guard. Don’t shoot in a hurry,
because you might pepper me, and that’s something
I object to. Now I’m off.”
</p>
<p>
“Good luck to you, Frank, and take care of
yourself,” said Will.
</p>
<p>
Frank made his way into the brush. He could
have approached the other camp with far less
trouble had he chosen to keep along the edge of
the water. It struck him, however, that the
enemy might anticipate a raid of some sort after
their recent miserable attempt to cripple the members
of the Rod, Gun and Camera Club in their
resources, and be on the watch for stragglers
along the beach.
</p>
<p>
They would possibly not dream that any one
would take all the trouble to push through the
dense brush, and climb the hill, at the base of
which they had squatted upon landing.
</p>
<p>
Frank was in no hurry. He knew that Pet’s
companions would be all excited over his bedraggled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
condition when he reached shore. Still,
it was hardly probable that they would venture
to take up the cudgels, and attempt any more
mischief, that night at least.
</p>
<p>
He remembered what a healthy respect these
fellows entertained for the guns in the possession
of the club members. They were more apt to
take it out in making all manner of tremendous
plans against the peace of the campers which they
would hardly be likely to carry out when their
anger had had a chance to cool.
</p>
<p>
As he drew near the place, Frank found that
a little hill interposed, just as the abrupt bluff
did in the case of their own camp. This he would
have to climb ere he could look down upon those
he had come to observe.
</p>
<p>
There was more or less difficulty in reaching
the top of this little elevation.
</p>
<p>
“They must go around here when entering
the woods,” Frank concluded, after he had finally
gained the top of the rise.
</p>
<p>
He hardly liked the idea of returning along the
same difficult lines; but when he felt this disinclination
he was really worrying over something
that was fated never to come about.
</p>
<p>
By degrees he pushed forward until he found
himself on the edge of a little declivity. Down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
below he could see the old dingy tent which he
knew so well, also the fire of the Peters crowd.
</p>
<p>
The boys were gathered around, watching Pet,
partly disrobed, trying to warm himself near the
blaze; but if he was shivering outwardly with the
cold, he seemed to be burning within, to judge
from the motions he made while talking.
</p>
<p>
“Evidently Pet is making a vow to settle my
hash the first time we meet. But I don’t seem
to be trembling, that I can discover. I know Pet
of old, and how easy he can change his mind,”
Frank told himself, as he watched.
</p>
<p>
Unable to see just as well as he wished from
where he first knelt, he moved a little to the left,
as that seemed to promise a better view.
</p>
<p>
It was the last straw upon the camel’s back.
Already, though Frank did not know it, the
treacherous soil was giving way under his weight,
and this move on his part aggravated the trouble.
</p>
<p>
He felt himself slipping, tried to catch hold of
a nearby bush, which gave way in his frenzied
grasp, and down the steep incline he plunged!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—THE WILD MAN DEVELOPS AN APPETITE</h2>
<p>
“Great smoke! what’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s the wild man, fellers!”
</p>
<p>
“Run, afore he gits yuh!”
</p>
<p>
There was an immediate scramble among the
adherents of Pet Peters. What they had heard
about the wild man of the island had kept them
on edge throughout the entire length of their
short sojourn; and now, when this sudden object
came rolling down the incline into their very
camp they were panic stricken.
</p>
<p>
Pet himself was just as frightened as any of
his mates. He had been sitting by the fire, drying
his back, having removed his coat and trousers
meanwhile. As the alarm sounded he tried to get
to his feet so as to join in the hasty flight, but,
as might be expected, his legs became twisted,
and consequently he fell in a heap.
</p>
<p>
“Wow! keep off’n me, you! I ain’t done
nuthin’!” he yelled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
It was his customary plea when caught doing
something wrong.
</p>
<p>
Frank had by this time reached the bottom
of the incline, for which he was not at all sorry.
He had not been seriously hurt by his rough
tumble, and, thinking only of keeping himself
aloof from these ugly spirits, he managed to
scramble to his feet after some fashion.
</p>
<p>
Through it all he had kept a firm grip on his
gun, as though he knew what protection he could
count on from that source.
</p>
<p>
There was another grand picture that escaped
Will, and which he would never cease to lament
the loss of—Frank regaining his feet, those
fellows scampering away in several directions,
and Pet on his knees, holding one arm up as if
to ward off some evil blow which he expected to
descend.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, it’s only Langdon! Kim back here, yuh
cowards!” bellowed Pet, as soon as his startled
eyes could tell him the truth.
</p>
<p>
And the others, halted in the midst of their
mad flight, looking back, saw that instead of the
terrible hairy wild man of their dreams it was
indeed only a boy who stood there, and he the
one they hated most of all.
</p>
<p>
So they came straggling back, some looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
sheepish over their recent scare, while others
scowled as if in an ugly temper.
</p>
<p>
“Wot yuh want here, Langdon?” demanded
Pet, bridling up as he saw that much was expected
of him by his followers.
</p>
<p>
It was unfortunate that this should happen
so soon after he had been making such enormous
threats about what he was going to do to Frank
when next they met.
</p>
<p>
What could a fellow do anyway when he was
minus his coat and trousers, as well as shoes?
</p>
<p>
Frank had recovered his lost breath by now.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I might have strolled over here just
to ask whether you had arrived safely after your
swim; and to express a hope that you might not
take cold. It’s pretty early in the season to go in,
you know,” he said smoothly.
</p>
<p>
The others looked at each other as if they
hardly knew what to make of it. Somehow this
Langdon always did seem to have the advantage
whenever they came face to face. In the canoe
he was Pet’s master, because he felt quite at home
there, while the other did not. Now, here ashore,
he held something in his hands which none of
them liked the looks of—a double-barreled shotgun.
</p>
<p>
“Aw, go chase yerself! ’Twan’t that as
fetched yuh here. Think we scooped sumpin, an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
yuh come sneakin’ round tryin’ tuh see,” snarled
the shivering Pet.
</p>
<p>
“Come up to the fire and keep warm. It’s your
fire; I don’t lay any claim to it. Perhaps you
fellows think I slid down that toboggan track
on purpose? Well, you’ve got another guess
coming, then. I have more respect for my clothes
than to try such things, as a rule.”
</p>
<p>
Frank was talking for a purpose. He did not
expect to enter the camp of the enemy when he
parted from Will and Bluff; but now that circumstances
beyond his control had caused such
a move on his part, he meant to take full advantage
of it.
</p>
<p>
Before he left, he expected to know positively
what they had in that tent. If Jerry was found
there, a prisoner, he must be set free, no matter
what happened after such a move.
</p>
<p>
So, as he talked he kept moving a little at a
time in the direction of the said tent. If the
others noticed his action they could not give any
sort of guess as to what he was after. Besides,
he kept that gun always half raised, and moving
back and forth, from side to side, so that it
covered the entire bunch.
</p>
<p>
“Jest yuh make tracks outen here, Langdon.
Yuh ain’t wanted, see? This here’s our camp,
an’ yer intrudin’,” chattered Pet, who was compelled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
to creep closer to the fire, for he was shivering
as though he had the ague.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’m going right away, boys. I assure
you I haven’t the least intention of staying and
putting you to any inconvenience. Just a little
social call, you understand, Pet. I couldn’t bear
the thought that possibly you were still floundering
around out there on the lake. Glad to know
you arrived,” Frank continued, now close to the
flap of the tent.
</p>
<p>
The others had unconsciously followed him, so
that with the exception of Pet the whole of the
camp’s inmates were clustered just in front of
the intruder.
</p>
<p>
As he uttered the last word, Frank suddenly
stooped. He had seen his chance, and meant to
investigate the interior of that tent.
</p>
<p>
To his dismay it was far from light inside. He
could just make out objects dimly. There might
be a prostrate figure on some of the dirty blankets
strewing the ground, for all he could say.
</p>
<p>
Determined to make sure, he immediately
darted inside the tent. A chorus of excited exclamations
arose from the half circle of roughs
outside.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a-goin’ ter steal our blankets, that’s
what!” shouted one.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let him, fellers!” whooped Pet, dancing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
one bare foot to the other in his excitement,
but not offering to lend a hand in corralling
the intruder.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you, wot yer want in there?” howled
another, looking around for a cudgel that might
come in handy.
</p>
<p>
Then Frank emerged. He still kept his handy
gun in evidence, seeing which the others backed
away again, not being quite so eager as they
imagined to come to hand-grips with this determined
boy.
</p>
<p>
Frank was disappointed. He had failed to
find the slightest trace of his missing chum in the
tent of the Peters crowd. This seemed to prove
that they knew nothing about the kidnapping of
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
Under the circumstances he thought it might
be just as well to explain his queer move a little.
The knowledge might hasten the departure of
these rowdy fellows, and purge the island of their
presence.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you what I was looking for. One
of my chums has strangely disappeared, and we
thought that perhaps you had him here. That’s
all. But I find you haven’t; which makes me
believe he’s fallen into the hands of that wild
man, or else the two hobo thieves who robbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the man on the steamboat; because we happen
to know they’re here on this island.”
</p>
<p>
“Wot’s that?” demanded Pet, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you heard about the two tramps on
the <em>Eastern Star</em>, didn’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yuh mean the fellers as collared the roll o’
Mister Pemberton?” asked Pet, forgetting to
even shiver, in his new excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and they’re here on this island right
now, hungry and desperate,” continued Frank,
thinking it good policy to rub it in good and
hard while he was about it.
</p>
<p>
“Here on this yer island—them desperadoes
are?” gasped one.
</p>
<p>
“That’s easy to say, Langdon; but how d’ye
know?” demanded Pet.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ve seen them, for one thing. Then
they robbed us of a kettle with our supper last
night. Let a cord down from the top of the
cliff, and caught the bale of the kettle with a hook.
First thing we knew, our supper was sailing up,
and that was the last we ever saw of it,” replied
Frank, now beginning to edge toward the beach,
as he had suddenly decided to return by an easier
path than the one he had taken in coming.
</p>
<p>
Then the boys looked at each other uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“A wild man loose here; an’ now them two
desperate critters huntin’ round fur anythin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
loose. Say, fellers, it’s up ter us ter git outen
this in the mornin’,” said Pet, shaking his head
with determination.
</p>
<p>
And not one of his mates lifted his voice, even
in a whisper, contrarywise. Indeed, to tell the truth,
they looked as though the hours that must elapse
ere they departed hence would fairly drag along.
</p>
<p>
Frank, believing that he had reached a point
where he could boldly make his exit from the
hostile camp, was just in the act of backing away
when he saw something that gave him a shock.
</p>
<p>
“Say, look yonder, you fellows, what’s happening
to your provision basket!” he exclaimed,
pointing with his gun.
</p>
<p>
Every boy whirled around, and as he did so
a concerted howl went up, partly of rage, though
terror could be plainly detected in the chorus.
There was a swiftly moving figure carrying off
the big basket in which all the balance of their
supplies happened to be gathered. And such a
figure—whether a wild man or a gigantic ape—it
would be impossible to say, for in the quick
glimpse which Frank had of it ere the Thing
vanished among the bushes he could only positively
say that it seemed to be covered with hair,
and when its face was turned it looked a cross
between that of a demented human being and a
great ape!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—BLUFF TAKES CHANCES</h2>
<p>
There never was such a frightened group of
fellows as that crowd when they saw their basket
of provisions vanish in the grip of this awful-looking
object.
</p>
<p>
For a few seconds they seemed too astonished
to even move, and the thief had actually gone
out of sight in the brush before the first boy
made a jump after him.
</p>
<p>
Whether it was a touch of valor that actuated
him, or the desire to get back the precious basket
that held their food, it would be hard to say.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” shouted Frank, who had seen
something descending along the face of the little
rise.
</p>
<p>
Even as he spoke a shower of stones, together
with lumps of earth, fell with a great clatter.
Somebody was bombarding the camp from above!
It looked as though the wild man must have had
wings to reach that spot, if the missiles came
from him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
By this time Pet himself was in full flight.
He had snatched up his loose garments from the
sticks on which they were drying at the fire, and
made for the shelter of the bushes on the other
side of the camp.
</p>
<p>
The rest scampered this way and that, one
even hiding inside the tent, while a couple of
others tried to budge the heavy boat that had
been drawn up high and dry on the shore, as if
seriously considering the chances of flight.
</p>
<p>
Frank saw his opportunity to get away, and
was not slow to avail himself of it.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks, awfully, Mr. Wild Man; I’m indebted
to you,” he laughed, as he started along
the little beach, headed for his own camp.
</p>
<p>
He knew his chums would be dreadfully anxious
by this time. They must have surely heard
the excited cries from the other camp, and would
be alarmed lest something had happened to him.
</p>
<p>
As he drew near he whistled. This was a
signal that Bluff should recognize, and which
would tell him who approached, so that he would
not be tempted to fire, or make any threatening
demonstration.
</p>
<p>
“Welcome back, Frank!” exclaimed Bluff, as
he appeared in sight.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, we’re glad to see you safe and sound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
From the racket we began to be afraid that you’d
got into trouble,” observed Will.
</p>
<p>
“The trouble seemed to be on the other side,
boys. They’ve fared worse than we did. In
our case it was only a kettle full of stew; but
they lost everything!”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that? Do you mean somebody
cribbed their grub?” demanded Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Just what happened, and right under my
eyes, too. I saw it done. Oh! what you missed
then, Will! If you could only have snapped off
that picture, there wouldn’t be a single soul in
Centerville doubt the story about the wild man,”
said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Wild man! Do you mean to say he entered
their camp while you were there?”
</p>
<p>
“And actually grabbed up their stuff under
your eyes? Then you can tell us what he looked
like. Was it really a man, or an animal, Frank?”
questioned Bluff, excitedly.
</p>
<p>
Frank shook his head, as he replied:
</p>
<p>
“There you’ve got me, for just on the spur
of the moment I couldn’t say positively. He
walked on two legs, and seemed like a man; but
looked like a great big chimpanzee, or an ape,
I’ve seen do tricks at the circus. Anyway, he
was a terrible object, and sent a shiver over me.”
</p>
<p>
“Gracious goodness! and he stole their provisions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
you said?” exclaimed Will, involuntarily
looking around as if he half expected the dreadful
wild man to rush into view right then and
there.
</p>
<p>
“Everything they had, I imagine. One good
thing, it will make them get out in the morning,
and for that we’re obliged to the wild man. If
only Jerry were here, now, I’d be feeling first-class,”
resumed Frank, with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t understand why he’d enter their
camp when he could have gotten a lot of much
better grub right here in ours,” said Bluff, shaking
his head.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, he’s evidently afraid of our
guns; and, perhaps, he happened to know that
they had none over yonder,” explained Frank.
</p>
<p>
“But is that reasonable? Would a crazy man
stop for such a little thing as that? It strikes
me this raid on their eating department looks like
a set-up job.”
</p>
<p>
“There now, Bluff, you’ve set me to thinking
again. I neglected to tell you all that happened.
When the hairy monster was making off with
the basket, one of the boys started after him;
and then and there a shower of stones and dirt
came down from above, and fell all around him.
After that there was a quick scattering,” remarked
Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“Evidently the wild man had a friend close
by; he wasn’t alone then. Say, perhaps he’s
formed a league with those ugly hoboes. They’re
all a hungry lot, and ready to steal anything that
comes along in the way of grub.”
</p>
<p>
“Again you may be right, Bluff. If you keep
on guessing I’m sure we’ll know all about the
whole business soon,” laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“But how about that other scheme of yours?”
asked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that—the trip to town?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Haven’t changed your mind about it,
eh, Frank?” asked the other.
</p>
<p>
“Are you willing to make the attempt?”
queried Frank, promptly.
</p>
<p>
“Try me, that’s all. Now that the old moon’s
up it will be just fun. I can make it in a little
time, and hunt up the sheriff. Why, the lot of
us may even be back here by morning, boys,”
replied Bluff, enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
He always went into anything with his whole
soul, though perhaps his ardor might cool sooner
than the grim determination of Frank, or even
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“That would be fine. Well, since you don’t
object, suppose you get the canoe ready. Will and
I will remain to watch the camp, because we seem
to be surrounded by a raft of enemies, all eager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
to do us a bad turn if they can. With Jerry
missing, the case looks serious, and something
must be done to round these bad men up.”
</p>
<p>
Bluff immediately jumped up and hurried over
to where the three canoes were fastened together
with the chain and padlocks. He proceeded to
get his own boat free from all entanglements,
and presently had it launched upon the water.
</p>
<p>
Then he came back for the paddle and to receive
any parting instructions Frank might see
fit to give him.
</p>
<p>
“Make reasonably good time, Bluff, but don’t
push yourself, mind. There’s no such great hurry
as all that. When you get to town go right
away to police headquarters and see if you can
find Mr. Dodd.”
</p>
<p>
“What if he happens to be away?” asked
Bluff, wishing to be prepared for any emergency
that might chance to arise.
</p>
<p>
“Then wait as long as you can for him. Should
you get tired in the end, leave a letter to be delivered
as soon as he shows up; then return to
us here. It may be possible, even as you hint,
that the sheriff is away hunting the woods to
the south for those two rascally, thievish hoboes.
That’s all, Bluff. Good-by, and good luck!”
</p>
<p>
Bluff shook hands with each of his chums.
Then he gave his canoe a push that started it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
going out, sprang in over the stern with the
accurate balance of an expert, picked up his
paddle and commenced his moonlight cruise back
to town.
</p>
<p>
Frank and Will stood there watching him as
long as they could see the dark object upon the
moonlit water of the lake; then they turned and
silently entered the camp once more.
</p>
<p>
From somewhere out upon the great stretch
of water came the strange cry of a loon that had
lingered ere going to its northern summer home.
The sound was particularly mournful, it seemed
to Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Can he make it, do you think?” asked Will,
who seemed unusually worried to-night; for all
these stories about wonderful chances which he
had lost had begun to work upon his mind.
</p>
<p>
“Without the slightest doubt. Why not?
There’s no sea running, the wind has died away
to a whisper, and the moon is bright. Why,
Bluff would like nothing better than a circuit
of the entire lake at such a time,” replied Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I was just wondering whether anything
might get after him on the water, that’s all,”
remarked the other.
</p>
<p>
“Chuck that sort of talk. Don’t be a pessimist,
Will. Of course he can make it, and, perhaps,
as he says, they may all be here by morning, ready
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
to gather in those clever rascals,” declared Frank,
stoutly.
</p>
<p>
“But why do you suppose they ever came here
to Wildcat Island to hide?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been thinking about that. There’s that
Waddy Walsh you speak about—since he has
lived here he possibly knows something about
this place. Then again they may have heard
about the wild man, and how the island is
shunned by every one in the neighborhood. In
that case, you see, it would offer a splendid
hiding-place for a couple of men trying to escape
the sheriff.”
</p>
<p>
“Frank, you just seem to hit on the right thing.
That must be the fact. And our coming here
rather upset their plans,” said Will.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but it gave them a supper last night.
They must have been too hurried in their flight
to lay in any stock of food. Perhaps they intended
going across to the mainland from time
to time, and stealing chickens from the farmers.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be jiggered if I can see how there could
be any connection between those scamps and that
wild man with the hairy hide. Perhaps it was
an ape, and he has a mate on the island. Would
you shoot him if you saw him, Frank?”
</p>
<p>
“H’m, that depends. Certainly not unless I
thought my life was in danger. I say that, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
I really believe myself that it is a human
being. And I have a little suspicion that is hardly
strong enough as yet to mention, but which
I intend to think over. But let us settle down
and take things as comfortable as we can. I’ll
stand watch for a while, and then let you take
my place. Lie down and rest, Will.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—PLAYING THE GAME</h2>
<p>
“Hello! Frank!”
</p>
<p>
“What now?” and the one addressed sat up
suddenly, wide awake it seemed.
</p>
<p>
“It’s morning,” said Will, “and I’m tired of
keeping watch, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
Frank laughed good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
“That’s quite enough, old fellow. Time I was
up and about, for this promises to be a day that
we may mark with a white stone in the log of
our outing. The sun is going to get in sight
presently. No signs of Bluff coming back?”
</p>
<p>
“He hasn’t arrived. I didn’t look out over
the lake yet. Seems to be something of a haze,
or morning fog on the water, so you can’t see
very far,” replied Will.
</p>
<p>
Frank stepped to where he could have a clear,
unobstructed view up the lake. As his chum had
said, there were patches of fog rising off the
water, but this was vanishing rapidly. Already
one could see for quite some distance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“See anything, brother?” called out Will, who
was already beginning to put the coffee in the
pot.
</p>
<p>
He had been on duty for several hours, and
felt a bit hungry. Boys can eat six times a day
when in the woods, for the open air seems to
develop most tremendous appetites.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing except the solitary old loon that
kept up such a screeching last night,” replied the
lookout, shading his eyes with his hand, the
better to look.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like that. Hope nothing has happened
to poor old Bluff.”
</p>
<p>
“There you go again. What could happen
to him? He’s a cracking good swimmer, and
even if he had an upset, which is most unlikely,
he would hang to his canoe. The boat couldn’t
sink with metallic air-chambers at both ends,”
answered Frank.
</p>
<p>
“But surely he’s had plenty of time to get
there and back?”
</p>
<p>
“Granted; but you heard what I told him—to
wait for a reasonable time if he found the sheriff
away. No doubt Mr. Dodd is out searching
high and low for the very fellows we know to
be here on Wildcat Island. Give Bluff more
time. Take my word for it, he will show up
when he gets good and ready, if not with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
posse, then alone. Bluff doesn’t like to be left
out in the cold when there’s anything of a rumpus
going on. Want some help getting breakfast,
Will?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps so, unless you are contented to eat
cold boiled rice; we’ve got plenty and to spare
of that dish,” answered the novice cook, with a
grin.
</p>
<p>
“I rather think that would be a poor breakfast
dish. The stomach wants something warm
about this time. Are all the eggs that we brought
gone?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I saw several in the coffee can just now.
Somebody stuck them in there to keep from
breaking them, I guess. How will you have
yours?” answered Will.
</p>
<p>
“Leave it to me, and I’ll see that we have an
appetizing mess. An omelet for mine, I think.
But after all, I don’t seem so very hungry.
Worrying about Jerry has somehow affected my
spirits, and a fellow can’t eat much when he feels
downcast.”
</p>
<p>
In spite of all drawbacks both boys did full
justice to the breakfast that was spread on the
table after a little while. Will kept tabs on
whatever his companion did.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to learn how to cook everything
that one would be apt to want in a camp; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
if you don’t mind explaining I’ll begin right
now to take a few lessons,” he said as Frank
started to break the eggs into a pannikin, preparatory
to beating them up, and adding the shredded
bits of ham they had left over from the previous
day.
</p>
<p>
When the meal was finished and the dishes and
cooking utensils properly washed up, Frank sat
down to wait for Bluff to appear up the lake,
while Will vanished inside the tent to bother with
his films.
</p>
<p>
He had brought along an apparatus whereby
he could develop these, no matter as to the time
or conditions—daylight being just the same as
darkness.
</p>
<p>
Frank heard him talking to himself inside the
tent, but paid no attention to what he was saying,
for at that moment he noticed a moving object
up the lake, which he really believed might
be the canoe of his chum, Bluff, returning alone.
</p>
<p>
If this proved to be the case another disappointment
awaited the campers, and the rescue
of poor Jerry might again be postponed to an
unknown time. The sheriff being away, no one
could tell when he would receive the letter Bluff
was to leave for his perusal, and hence it might
be many hours ere a move was made.
</p>
<p>
By that time the hoboes could have quitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
the island and lost themselves in the dense woods
of the mainland, while Jerry’s hiding-place would
remain unknown, so that he might even die of
neglect.
</p>
<p>
The coming of Will broke in upon Frank’s
gloomy communion.
</p>
<p>
Apparently Will had some reason for excitement.
He was holding a developed film in his
hand as he rushed up to Frank.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think it was set my flashlight
trap off last night?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“A ’coon, doubtless—that seems most likely,”
answered the other, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
“Guess again,”
</p>
<p>
“’Possum—wildcat—surely not a bear, though
I did hear quite a scramble over in that quarter
at the time? Go on and tell me,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
For answer Will held the film up so that it was
between the light and the eyes of his companion.
</p>
<p>
“It’s been in the hypo, and is fixed, but not
thoroughly washed; but you can see for yourself,”
he exclaimed triumphantly.
</p>
<p>
Frank gave an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“Why, you caught a man!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and his face is turned exactly toward
the camera. The snap made him look, and with
the flash he was indelibly impressed on the film.
What is more, if you look at it on the other side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
and partly turned away, you can see the positive
of his face as plain as day. It’s Waddy, all
right. I got him!” laughed the photographer, in
glee.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s worth something. I’m beginning
to realize the tremendous possibilities of a
camera at times. That evidence would be accepted
in court as conclusive. Go, and wash the
film carefully, Will. If you fail to get a few
great scenes, you don’t lose everything, it seems.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t that the Peters tribe setting sail, Frank?”
</p>
<p>
“Why it is, as sure as you live. I wonder
they stayed so late. They must be pretty hungry
by this time if that educated ape got away with
all they had. Perhaps we might have made a
master stroke if we’d gone over this morning
with an offering of some bacon, coffee and such
things. Too bad neither of us thought of it
before.”
</p>
<p>
Will looked strangely at his companion. He
could not wholly understand the impulses that
guided the actions of the other. His experience
in the world had not been as varied as that of
the boy from Maine, or he might have realized
what was meant; though possibly the act of kindness
might, after all, have been wasted on those
tough young citizens.
</p>
<p>
“They’re going home, all right, and good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
riddance. If we could only get rid of the balance
of undesirable people on this same island,
there might be a chance for us to finish up our
outing in peace,” he remarked bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they don’t give Bluff any trouble,”
said Frank, as if musing.
</p>
<p>
“Bluff—is he in sight, then?” demanded his
comrade, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, over there, and coming,” replied Frank,
pointing to the advancing canoe.
</p>
<p>
“Here are your glasses. Suppose you take
a look and see.”
</p>
<p>
Will handed over the marine glasses as he
spoke. As he adjusted them to his eyes, Frank
swept one glance at the coming Bluff. Then he
turned his attention to the departing disgusted
campers.
</p>
<p>
“Something has been going on among those
fellows, I declare,” he announced.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked his companion,
in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“They seem to have been up against it, or
else having a fight among themselves. I can
see a couple who have bandages about their
heads, and one seems to be holding his arm
mighty tenderly. I believe it is broken.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say? Well, come to think of it,
I do remember hearing something of a commotion a while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
back, but thought they were only
having their usual rough-house time. Please let
me look, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
A minute later he uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
“What now?” it was Frank’s turn to ask.
</p>
<p>
“Seems strange to me. I think there must
be one of them lying down in the bottom of the
boat,” returned Will.
</p>
<p>
“That would indicate something pretty serious.
Perhaps they’ve had a fight with those
hoboes, or it may have been our wild man. But
what makes you think such a thing, Will?”
</p>
<p>
“I counted seven of them when they came,
and so did Bluff. Now there are only six in
sight, and as you say, three of them are fit for
the hospital. Where can the seventh be?”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the hoboes got him, just as they did
Jerry. If so, what under the sun can their scheme
be? Why load down with a variety of Centerville’s
leading citizens when they find it so hard
to provide food for themselves?”
</p>
<p>
“I give it up. The conundrum is too much
for me. But I think my idea is more apt to
cover the truth, and that the seventh boy is laid
out in the boat, wounded, or perhaps dead,”
continued Will, in an awe-struck tone.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I hope not the latter. They’re a rough
bunch, but they’ve had little opportunity to learn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
better, and we mustn’t be too hard on them. Such
fellows can do things that would be little short
of a crime for those of us who have decent homes
and indulgent parents. Bluff seems to be coming
along rather slowly, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
As Frank said this his companion turned the
glasses upon the canoe.
</p>
<p>
“Something has happened to him. Perhaps his
paddle has broken; I remember it gave way while
we were coming here, and he spliced it yesterday.
Yes, that must be what ails him,” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“That’s too bad,” observed Frank, looking at
the other boats, as though wondering whether
it might be worth while to launch one, and speed
out on the lake to the assistance of the chum who
was coming.
</p>
<p>
But the distance was too great, and he could
not hope to reach the scene before whatever was
fated to happen had occurred.
</p>
<p>
“Why do you say that Bluff could get here
with only a piece of his paddle?” remarked Will.
</p>
<p>
“If those ugly chaps let him. See, they have
already changed their course several points. They
mean to intercept him.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t think they’d bother with him, do
you?” cried Will.
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid they’re in a bad humor, and ready
to tackle anything that offers a chance to work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
off old scores. If Bluff only had his paddle in
decent order he could laugh at them. How foolish
of him to take only his single blade along.”
</p>
<p>
Frank now clapped the glasses to his eyes
again.
</p>
<p>
“Look at that, will you? Why, the breezy
chap doesn’t even think it worth while to turn
and run, or even try to slip past. He’s coming
directly on, and in another minute will run
slap into that rowboat, loaded with toughs. I’m
afraid there’s going to be a bad spill for our
headstrong chum,” he sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he is only holding himself in reserve,
and means to make a spurt for it at the very last
second. Bluff is smart, I tell you. He knows
what those boys are up to, and is far from being
asleep. Tell me what he is doing, Frank. I can
hear them shouting angrily at him now. Oh!
I wish we were out there to help him.”
</p>
<p>
Will even forgot his natural timidity, and had
the chance been given him, would doubtless have
proven a hero in defense of his chum.
</p>
<p>
“He seems to have stopped paddling altogether.
Now he reaches down into the bottom
of his canoe after something. He is aiming it
at them—it’s his paddle—no it isn’t either—as
sure as you live, he’s got that repeating-gun of
his!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
Even as the excited Frank spoke, over the
water they heard a distant voice shout:
</p>
<p>
“Hands up! you sharks, or I’ll pepper you
good and hard. Six shots I’ve got here, as fast
as I can pump the lever. Hands up! I say, every
one of you!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—SIGNS THAT SPELLED TROUBLE</h2>
<p>
“Look! they’re doing it, too, Frank! Oh! what
luck! Good for Bluff!” ejaculated Will, hardly
able to control himself in his excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Just as sure as you live, they are. They
knew Bluff meant business when he said that.
Why, even the wounded fellow has his one well
arm raised. It’s great!”
</p>
<p>
Frank generously handed the glasses to his
comrade, whose hands trembled so that he could
hardly hold them to his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What’s he doing now, Will?”
</p>
<p>
“Seems to be holding that blessed gun with
one hand, and paddling softly with the other.
Ain’t he the real thing, though? And once we
doubted whether he would be just the right sort
of fellow to be a member of the club. I’m proud
of good old Bluff, and that’s a fact!” cried Will.
</p>
<p>
“So say we all of us. He must be past the
other boat by now; isn’t he?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and has laid the gun down, but where
he can grab it up in a hurry if necessary. Pet
and his crowd have resumed rowing, too, as if
going ashore. They don’t seem anxious to call
out at Bluff just now. Jerry used to say that
terrible gun would frighten game to death; but
even Jerry would have to admit that it’s worth
while, if he could only be here, to see this lovely
sight. Oh! why didn’t I have my camera ready?
What a good picture that would have been,”
sighed the official photographer of the club.
</p>
<p>
“Too far away to make out what was going
on, my boy. But I only wish Jerry could have
been here to see it. That would relieve me of
my anxiety,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
The canoe kept moving straight toward them,
while the heavily laden boat continued over the
lake toward the western shore.
</p>
<p>
Not even a derisive howl was sent after Bluff.
He seemed to have effectually cowed the rowdies.
Perhaps it was the last straw that broke the
camel’s back, and they had really gone through
so much lately that the limit had been reached.
</p>
<p>
Bluff presently landed directly beside his
chums.
</p>
<p>
“Well done, old fellow!” said Will, hastening
to pat him on the back.
</p>
<p>
“It was as fine a piece of bluff as I ever put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
up,” grinned the paddler as he stepped ashore,
holding the redoubtable gun in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“How so?” demanded Will, curious to know.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the gun isn’t in a condition to use. I
had it at a locksmith’s, and thought I’d bring it
along if he had mended it. Said he had, but
didn’t have time to finish putting all the parts
together again. I said I could do that easily
enough in camp, and fetched it along,” replied
the other, chuckling.
</p>
<p>
“Then it wasn’t loaded at all?” asked Will.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not; but then they didn’t know that,
you see. It was a case of where ignorance was
bliss. Answered the purpose all right. You
noticed they let me alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Now I see where you got your name; but
that was a time when bluffing was worth while.
Come and sit down here and have some breakfast,”
remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
He was looking closely at the returned wanderer,
as if trying to decide whether he brought
good news or bad.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me first, have you heard anything from
Jerry?” demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
“Not the least thing. But I’ve been making
up a plan that it seems we will have to follow,
since you come back alone,” observed Frank.
</p>
<p>
Of course this was an invitation for Bluff to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
unload, and tell what he had accomplished besides
getting his gun just before starting back.
</p>
<p>
“Sheriff out hunting the hobo thieves, just
as you feared. No one could say as to when he
would return. Might be in an hour, and again,
perhaps, it would not be for the balance of the
day,” he began.
</p>
<p>
“You waited until you got tired and then
left a note for him?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I did, fellows. The whole community
is aroused. Seems like these two hoboes
must be yeggmen for keeps. At any rate several
robberies occurred on the night following the
affair on the steamer. A farmer reported that
his place was entered and some money and other
things taken. Then the thieves broke open the
storage warehouse over in Newtonport, and rummaged
through a lot of stuff. No one knows
what they took there, but they left everything in
a great upset. The local militia company in our
town is out helping the sheriff hunt!”
</p>
<p>
“Say, things seem to be stewing at a great
rate,” gasped Will.
</p>
<p>
“And to think that the nervy chaps responsible
for it all are here on this very island near us.
Yes, more than that, we’ve had experiences with
them, and even now they undoubtedly are holding our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
poor chum for ransom, or some other
purpose,” declared Frank, shaking his head.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think Mr. Dodd will come?” asked
Will.
</p>
<p>
“He certainly will, as soon as he knows. Why
wouldn’t he when the men he’s on the lookout
for are here waiting for him?” replied Bluff,
beginning to eat.
</p>
<p>
“You said you were thinking up a plan,
Frank?” suggested Will, turning eagerly to the
chum upon whom the rest were accustomed to
rely in emergencies.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I leave it to the rest of you whether
we do it or not. The conditions are peculiar.
We want to search for poor Jerry, and yet if
we leave our camp unguarded, those savages may
steal the whole outfit. Then again, Will naturally
doesn’t want to stay here alone while Bluff
and myself do the hunting. I can see only one
way of fixing it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. I’m willing to do anything you
say,” remarked the one who had a cup of coffee
up to his lips, and was drinking the contents with
supreme pleasure.
</p>
<p>
“Ditto here, Frank,” from Will.
</p>
<p>
“This idea I had was to break up our camp,
stow all the stuff in the canoes, and then have
Will paddle far out on the lake with the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
outfit, where he could wait to see what happened.
Nothing could reach him there, and we would
be free to follow up our plan. How about that,
fellows?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
Will glanced out on the lake.
</p>
<p>
“All right. It looks like it would be quiet
enough, and if a big wind does come up, I can
paddle the string over to the shore and get under
the lee,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Call it settled, then. And now, while Bluff
is finishing his breakfast, you and I can be taking
down the tents and stowing them away,” observed
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’m about through now, but give me a
little time to get my gun together, boys. It may
come in handy, who knows,” remarked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“This is kind of tough, taking down tents
when our little outing is hardly half through
with,” complained Will, as he labored pulling up
tent pegs.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! it may be only temporary. If Mr. Dodd
comes and rounds up those hoboes as we expect,
there’s nothing to prevent our pitching camp
again right on the old spot, and enjoying another
two days or so of this business,” came from
Frank, who was under the falling canvas, working
like a beaver.
</p>
<p>
Things were quickly accomplished. The more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
one camps the easier it is to stow things away
in their proper places; and Frank was always
particular about doing this, as a labor-saving
device.
</p>
<p>
Hardly an hour after the coming of Bluff and
the space was bare. All the “dunnage” had been
snugly packed in two of the canoes, while Will
was ready to enter the other and convoy the
string out on the bosom of Lake Camalot.
</p>
<p>
They made him take Jerry’s gun as a means
of protection. On his part, Will entrusted his
precious camera to the tender mercies of Bluff,
in hopes that the other might find some chance to
snap off a few striking pictures while engaged in
his search for Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“And it isn’t like your gun, remember, for it’s
loaded,” he remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Well, my repeater is now. And perhaps
when Jerry learns what a part it has had in his
rescue he may stop sneering at it as a modern
joke,” said Bluff.
</p>
<p>
After Will had started, and gone some little
distance out on the lake, the two others left the
deserted camping-ground.
</p>
<p>
“Where away first?” asked Bluff, willing to
leave these matters to his friend, whose experience
up in Maine was apt to prove valuable now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“Let’s make along the beach for the place
where those chaps were,” replied Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I see. You think we may find the trail
of the wild man there?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m curious to see what it looks like, that’s
all. After that, I think of making for the place
where I lost Jerry. We’ve had no rain since,
and it seems to me we ought to take up the trail
at the place I lost it. I’ve since figured out how
I came to go wrong that time, and if we have
good luck, we ought to be able to follow it
straight to the place they’re staying at.”
</p>
<p>
It took them but a short time to reach the late
camp of Pet Peters and his cronies, which was
full of signs of a hasty departure.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what could have happened here?”
mused Frank, as he looked around.
</p>
<p>
“Seems like they must have been having a
high old time. There’s a remnant of a hat, and
I declare if this isn’t piece of a coat sleeve. It
was a fight, Frank, I tell you!” exclaimed Bluff,
convincingly.
</p>
<p>
“Just as I suspected, but, of course, we may
never know what caused it, and whether they
were just indulging in a little racket among
themselves or with the two hoboes. They had
little left that would induce those rascals to attack
them, seems to me,” remarked Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
“Listen! what was that?” suddenly asked
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
Both boys stood motionless, with heads cocked
on one side, straining their ears to catch a repetition
of the sound that had come to them.
</p>
<p>
Quickly they heard it again.
</p>
<p>
“Say, it seems like a groan to me,” whispered
Bluff, with eyes aglow.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I thought. There! that time I
located it, Bluff. Come over here. Good gracious!
what do you think of that?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE</h2>
<p>
“Why, it’s a boy!” exclaimed the horrified
Bluff, as he stared at the object from which the
sounds proceeded.
</p>
<p>
“And tied to a tree, too! You know him,
Bluff; look again!” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Say, it’s sure Tom Somers, one of Pet Peters’
crowd. What under the sun does it mean,
Frank?” exclaimed the other, startled and
mystified.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I said. They must have had a
monkey-and-parrot time among themselves, and
the Tom Somers’ section got the worst of it.
You see the result—they’ve gone off and left this
fellow fastened here as a punishment for his
rebellion.”
</p>
<p>
“But—this ain’t out West, or in the Cannibal
Islands. Wake me up and tell me if I’m seeing
things. What! do you mean to say those savages
would leave Tom here to starve to death?” gasped
Bluff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! no, some of them would come back by
to-night or to-morrow to let him off. I imagine
this is only some of Pet’s miserable work. He’s
a cruel monster. I thought Andy Lasher bad
enough, but it turned out that he had a speck
of good in him, and Jerry touched it when he
saved his life that stormy night. But Pet is
mean and revengeful, a sneak, and a coward at
heart.”
</p>
<p>
“There. I believe he has just discovered us,”
said Bluff.
</p>
<p>
The boy who was fastened to the tree gave a
groan, and then called out:
</p>
<p>
“Say, fellers, you wouldn’t go and leave me
here like this would you? Set me free anyway,
and I kin shift for myself somehow; but it’s
tough to be tied up like a dog, an’ all because I
knocked Pet down when he called me a name I
won’t take off any man or boy. Jest slice a knife
over these ropes, won’t you, please?”
</p>
<p>
He did not whine, but asked the favor in a
fairly decent way.
</p>
<p>
“Of course we will, Tom Somers. You’ve
always been an enemy of mine, but that’s no reason
we should leave you like this. There you
are!”
</p>
<p>
Frank purposely allowed his chum to do the
cutting. He knew that there had in the past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
been more or less bad blood between these two
lads, and he had in mind a possible repetition
of the singular friendship that had sprung up
between Jerry and Andy Lasher after the time
when the former saved the life of the town bully.
</p>
<p>
“That’s ‘white’ of you, Bluff, and I ain’t the
feller to forget it, neither,” was what the late
prisoner said as his bonds fell away.
</p>
<p>
“You look bruised more or less, so I take it
there must have been quite a fight here before
they went away?” remarked Frank, questioningly.
</p>
<p>
The other grinned, though the effort must
have pained him not a little, on account of the
many scratches and gouges on his face.
</p>
<p>
“Did they? Well, I should smile, pardner.
I only had one husky chap to stand by me, against
five; but we pretty nigh cinched things. Pet
Peters said he’d get even with me by leavin’ me
here a spell, to tempt that wild man. But I had
hopes some of you fellers might top the rise and
give me a helpin’ hand.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I remember now, you’re the chap who
was out West for a year herding cattle. I notice
it in your speech,” said Frank, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“It gets in the blood, when you mingle some
with them gents. I try to break off when the
fellers kid me, but it crops out when I ain’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
thinkin’. But say, it was ‘white’ of you to do
this, an’ I ain’t got any call to ask favors of
your crowd either.”
</p>
<p>
A sudden thought struck Frank.
</p>
<p>
“See here, you say you’re grateful; will you
prove it?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Tom Somers thrust out his chest as he immediately
replied:
</p>
<p>
“I’m a maverick if I don’t; try me!”
</p>
<p>
“Then listen. You heard me say that our
chum Jerry had strangely vanished yesterday
while we were in the woods. I have good reason
to believe those two hoboes laid hold of him, for
some reason or other,” Frank started.
</p>
<p>
“Ransom—the old, old game, perhaps?” suggested
the other, quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I hardly think it is quite so bad as that;
but they wanted to hold him as a sort of hostage,
perhaps, threatening us if we didn’t get off this
island. No matter what their reason, they’ve
got our chum, and now we mean to try and
release him. That’s why we’re here.”
</p>
<p>
“And you want me to help? ’Course I will,
and only too glad to have the chance. If it’s a
trail to foller, why I picked up lots of points out
there on the Texas plains, and just you set me
on the track,” said Tom, pulling on a tattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
coat that had been taken from him ere he was
fastened to the tree.
</p>
<p>
“Then let’s begin right here and see if there is
any trail where your grub basket went off last
night!” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
At that Tom started and turned a little pale.
</p>
<p>
“You said the hoboes, pard, and not that man-monkey,”
he stammered.
</p>
<p>
Plainly he had conceived a great fear regarding
the mysterious object that had appeared in the
camp, and vanished with their provisions.
</p>
<p>
Frank laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Make your mind easy, I’m not intending to
follow him. We expect to go to the place where
my pard vanished yesterday, and take up the trail
there. I followed it a while, but night was coming
on and I lost it. You may do better, Tom,”
he said.
</p>
<p>
“But you mentioned that hairy monster, didn’t
you?” queried the other, uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“I only want to examine the track he left, so
as to settle in my mind whether it was really a
crazy human being or a big ape. Come over here
and let’s see.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh! none of our fellers ever thought of
lookin’ around. A snake-whip couldn’t a-coaxed
’em over this way. Like as not they expected
the varmint was lyin’ in the bushes, waitin’ to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
jump out again. But I don’t pull leather when
I give my word.”
</p>
<p>
He threw himself prostrate on the ground. In
less than three minutes an exclamation announced
that he had found what he sought. Frank
dropped beside him.
</p>
<p>
“There she is, and a jim-dandy of a track, too,
plain as the hoof marks of a cayuse around a
snubbing post!” he exclaimed, pointing.
</p>
<p>
“Just as I thought, a man’s shoe, and an unusually
big one. That settles one thing in my
mind. It is no escaped ape that runs wild on
this island. It may be a lunatic that has got
away from the asylum over at Merrick, or——”
</p>
<p>
Frank did not finish his sentence, but nodded
his head as though the thought that had flashed
into his mind pleased him.
</p>
<p>
“That all here?” asked the other, a little nervously,
although apparently relieved to learn that
it was not a wild animal he had seen on the
preceding night.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’m entirely satisfied. Now let us find
the place where those Indian mounds are, and
we can get on the trail without delay,” answered
Frank, leading the way.
</p>
<p>
It took him fully an hour to accomplish this.
First they had to return to the spot at the foot
of the bluff where the canoeists’ camp had lately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
stood. Here his own trail was taken up, and
Tom Somers proved to the satisfaction of the
others that he did know considerable about following
tracks through thickets and woods, for
he led them unerringly until finally Frank saw
the two mounds.
</p>
<p>
“There they are,” he said, in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
Bluff pushed his gun forward menacingly.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” he demanded in a hoarse whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I mean the two Indian mounds, not the
hoboes. Come over here and see the trail made
as they went away,” replied his chum, quickly.
</p>
<p>
When the boy who had spent a year on a
Texas ranch punching cattle saw the marks, he
announced it as his opinion that they had been
made by two parties besides Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon your chum was snoozing some when
they jumped his claim. He kicked and put up
a right husky fight, but they was too much for
him, and choked him off. I reckon one of them
must a-been a boy, and the other a big man,
judgin’ from the marks. Then, when they had
reduced him to quiet they just snaked him off.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I thought—the big brute carried
Jerry on his back, for there are no signs of my
chum’s footprints around. Now, let’s start off.
I’m anxious to know the worst, no matter what
it is!” cried Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
Bluff brought up the rear. It was anything
but light under the dense growth of trees and
clinging vines. At times the tracker had to get
down close to the ground in order to see what he
wanted.
</p>
<p>
Bluff had slung his gun over his shoulder by
the strap, and was holding Will’s camera in his
hands, wondering if he had not been foolish to
bring such a silly thing along with him on so
serious an errand.
</p>
<p>
The deeper they penetrated into the interior
of the island the denser the undergrowth seemed
to become, until at times it was only with the
utmost difficulty they pushed their way through.
Others having gone ahead of them made it a
trifle easier, perhaps; at least Tom Somers said
so in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we’re gettin’ clost to the place, now,
pardners; so we’d better take our time an’ not
hustle too much. Don’t speak above a whisper,
either,” he said, as he parted the bushes in front.
</p>
<p>
Even as he did so Frank heard him utter a
low exclamation, not of fear so much as of disgust.
One look told the other what it meant, and
he, too, feared that their plans would all be disarranged
through an accidental meeting with a
resident of the jungle, who seemed disposed to
dispute their further progress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
There was the biggest wildcat Bluff had ever
seen in all his life squatted on the low limb of a
tree, growling angrily, and with it claws digging
into the bark after the manner of a cat that is
getting ready to jump, and will not be stopped!
</p>
<p>
True, Frank could easily have raised his gun
and shot the ferocious creature dead in its tracks;
but such an explosion must warn the enemy of
their presence in the vicinity, and effectually
prevent any surprise.
</p>
<p>
It looked like a serious problem, and yet it
must be solved immediately unless they wanted
to experience an encounter at close quarters with
that fury.
</p>
<p>
“Hold up! give me a chance. Duck your
heads, fellows; I’m going to flashlight the
critter!” exclaimed Bluff. And even as he spoke,
there was a sudden startling illumination that lit
up the immediate vicinity like day.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII—UNDER THE CABIN WALL</h2>
<p>
“So-long!” exclaimed the ex-cowboy, as he
dropped to the ground.
</p>
<p>
Frank did not know just then whether Tom
Somers was trying to evade an expected attack
from the big cat, or had been startled and alarmed
by the suspicious “click” behind him, instantly
followed by that electric flash.
</p>
<p>
“He’s gone!” whispered Bluff, excitedly.
</p>
<p>
Frank breathed a sigh of relief. The day had
been saved by Will’s inoffensive camera after all,
for there was no alarm, and they had escaped an
encounter with the poisonous claws of that beast
of prey.
</p>
<p>
“And I bet I got a dandy picture of him, too,
for Will. Say, this isn’t so bad, after all. Perhaps
there can be some fun hunting with a
camera,” pursued Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Silence, Bluff. Let’s lie here a bit and listen.
I hope we didn’t happen to be so close to their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
camp as to let them see that flash through the
trees,” whispered Frank, dropping down.
</p>
<p>
Five minutes later they once more began to
creep forward. At the suggestion of Tom
Somers, all of them were now on their knees,
Bluff, as before, bringing up the rear.
</p>
<p>
It was very thrilling work, and Bluff found
himself trembling with excitement as he trailed
after his companions.
</p>
<p>
“Sure he’s a peach at this sort of business,
and it was a bully streak of luck when we ran
across the poor wretch tied up to a tree,” he was
saying to himself, as he watched Tom Somers
gliding along, keeping an eye on the ground, and
sometimes almost poking his nose against the
earth in order to solve a knotty problem.
</p>
<p>
He hoped they would run up against no more
bobcats. While fortune had smiled upon them
on that last occasion, perhaps the same good luck
might not always be their portion; and Bluff
found no desire in his heart for a tussle at close
quarters with the owner of a set of claws such
as these beasts sported.
</p>
<p>
Frank and the other fellow seemed to be conferring
in low whispers, and hence he crept up
to learn what was in the wind.
</p>
<p>
“See anything, Frank?” he asked eagerly, as
he pushed in beside his chum.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“Softly, Bluff. Yes, if you look through this
little opening you can see it, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s a house—a sort of old cabin, more
like,” said Bluff, as he peeped.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what it is. Now, search your
memory, both of you—do you ever recollect hearing
about any one living on Wildcat Island?”
asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I do, now that you ask. There was
a queer man once who used to live like a hermit
here. That was years ago. They found his
skeleton in his cabin. Nobody ever knew what
he died of, but it was alone, excepting for his
dog, that ran wild till he was shot by a duck-shooter,”
whispered Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Glory! this here place is some on thrills,”
grumbled Tom Somers.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the things that are dead and
gone. We have more to fear from those that
are living. It looks as though the tramps have
taken up their quarters in the deserted shack of
the old hermit, doesn’t it, Tom?” asked Frank,
in the ear of the other.
</p>
<p>
“It sure does, for a fact. Like as not the
whole outfit is quartered there right now. And
somehow I got a suspicion that our grub meandered
this way, too. Seems like I see a familiar
Boston baked-bean can lying there by the door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
where they hustled it out after eating the
contents.”
</p>
<p>
Frank made no reply to this insinuation.
Whatever he thought he kept to himself.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I wonder is Jerry there?” said Bluff,
longingly, but managing to keep his tones
lowered.
</p>
<p>
“That is something we mean to discover before
a great while. I leave the manner of our
approach entirely to Tom here,” declared Frank.
</p>
<p>
The outcast from Pet’s camp had proven his
ability to be of great assistance to them, and
Frank believed in encouraging a fellow. His
words doubtless gave the other more or less
satisfaction. When a boy feels that he is wholly
trusted, he is very apt to do his level best.
</p>
<p>
“First of all I reckon there’s a better way to
crawl up close to the shack than this one we’re
on. So let’s trail around to the other side,
fellers,” he said.
</p>
<p>
They succeeded in reaching the point he had
in view. Even Bluff could see the wisdom of
the move. The undergrowth was much more
dense here, and extended quite up to the wall
of the dilapidated cabin.
</p>
<p>
They could see that the new occupants had
done some little rough tinkering in order to make
a roof that would shed water reasonably well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
From this it was easy to conclude that Waddy
Walsh and his partner did not know just how
long they might have to utilize this place as a
hide-out, and thought it best to be ready to stand
a rainy siege such as the Spring was apt to
produce at any day.
</p>
<p>
Frank felt Bluff clawing at his legs. There
was something in the act to tell him his chum
was desirous of speaking to him, and he allowed
the other to pull up alongside so they could put
their heads together.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you hear it?” queried Bluff, as if surprised.
</p>
<p>
“What? I heard nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“All that whistling on the lake. Sounded to
me like that little tug, <em>Rainy Day</em>, that tows the
lumber down to the outlet. She was close by,
too,” replied Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“It must have been away off, for I didn’t hear
a bit of it. Perhaps it was the tug, too; but she
belongs up at the other end of the lake. What
could bring her down here?”
</p>
<p>
“I had an idea that perhaps the sheriff and
his posse might be aboard her,” ventured Bluff,
and he was instantly seized by his comrade.
</p>
<p>
“That’s just what it meant. I hope Will’s
met them and told how the land lies here. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
that is true it means the beginning of the end?”
whispered Frank.
</p>
<p>
“And perhaps we may be back in our good
old camp by night time, who knows?” answered
the other, joyfully.
</p>
<p>
Still, neither of them had the slightest thought
of relaxing their efforts with regard to investigating
the interior of that cabin, and ascertaining
whether their comrade was being detained there
against his will, perhaps in bonds, that cut his
flesh cruelly.
</p>
<p>
Tom had noted the fact that the others were
holding a little powwow, and hence he did not
push on so as to leave them. In fact, Tom was
not at all particular about quitting the society
of these stout-hearted fellows even for a minute,
while in such a ghostly neighborhood. Tom believed
in spirits, and the story Bluff had told
about that skeleton was ever before him.
</p>
<p>
When they began to advance once more, he
also started off.
</p>
<p>
They were now so close to the cabin that if any
one had been talking aloud inside those old
moss-grown walls the boys could not have failed
to hear the sounds.
</p>
<p>
There had been a window, but it was closed
with a bunch of dead grass, and, of course, none
of the boys thought of trying to remove this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
obstacle in connection with their obtaining a view
of the interior. The only other opening, no
doubt, was the door, which was allowed to remain
wide open all the time for air and light.
</p>
<p>
Dare one of them crawl around the corner of
the cabin and try to look in at that entrance?
The risk seemed almost too much. Still, Frank
remembered that they had two guns among them,
while, so far as they knew, the hoboes possessed
none; at least they had shown nothing of the
sort thus far.
</p>
<p>
He had been thinking this over, however, and
concluded that it hardly stood to reason that such
desperate characters as these two, one an escaped
reform school inmate and the other a yeggman
tramp, would be entirely without some means
of defence. Perhaps one of them might have a
revolver which he had up to now kept out of
sight for some reason.
</p>
<p>
Tom was pulling at Frank’s trousers entreatingly.
Catching his attention, he made a gesture
with his hand, as talking was now out of the
question.
</p>
<p>
Following the line of his pointing finger, Frank
saw what had attracted the eye of the boy who
had been West. Some animal had for a time
used the hut as a lodging-place, and as the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
at the time may have been closed, had dug a
tunnel under the wall at the back of the place.
</p>
<p>
Possibly the men inside had filled the hole up
beyond the wall, but they had paid no attention
to that which lay beyond.
</p>
<p>
Frank caught the idea instantly. It was to
begin to tunnel under the wall, drawing away
the earth piecemeal until an opening was made,
when one of them might crawl through and make
discoveries.
</p>
<p>
The idea appealed to him somehow or other,
and, handing his gun silently to Tom, he set to
work lifting handfuls of loose dirt, and gradually
scooping out quite a hole. It was easy work
because the place had only recently been filled in.
As he worked he wondered what sort of an
animal had made the tunnel under the wall;
perhaps a wildcat, or it might have been a ’coon,
hardly a bear, though such big game could be
occasionally met with around Lake Camalot,
especially along the headquarters of Lumber Run
up at the other end of the body of water.
</p>
<p>
The minutes passed in this way. Several times
Frank caught some sound beyond the wall, but
could not make out what it might mean. He felt
positive, however, that it was the home of the
hoboes he had reached, and not a hiding-place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
of that strange creature so like a gigantic ape,
but which wore shoes like a man.
</p>
<p>
Now he felt the earth growing lighter, as
though he might be coming close to an end of
his strange task. He was still digging away,
eager to learn whether his plan could be carried
out, when without the slightest warning something
that moved came in contact with his flesh,
and he felt his fingers seized by a human hand!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX—HOLDING BLUFF IN</h2>
<p>
Frank involuntarily tried to draw his hand
back.
</p>
<p>
The grasp of the unknown, however, was too
strenuous, and he could not do so unless he
created such a disturbance as must have aroused
any sleeper nearby. Besides, a wild suspicion
had flashed through his mind. Perhaps this was
his chum Jerry, trying to escape from his place
of confinement.
</p>
<p>
He squeezed the fingers that clutched his. It
was a sign manual used in the secret society to
which both of them belonged in the Academy
at Centerville. To his great delight the secret
grip was returned immediately.
</p>
<p>
Then it <em>was</em> Jerry! He was alive, and even
at that moment endeavoring to get away from
those who were holding him against his will!
</p>
<p>
Frank felt like shouting aloud, so great a sense
of gratitude swept over him; but fortunately he
did not give way to such foolishness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
He put his head deep down into the hole he
had made and whispered, making just the faintest
sound possible:
</p>
<p>
“Jerry!”
</p>
<p>
“Frank!” came back like the sighing of the
wind up in some of those lofty trees that overhung
the lonely cabin with such a bad name.
</p>
<p>
Then the last doubt vanished. It only remained
to get Jerry out of that place as soon as
possible. Why, left to himself he seemed able
to force his way to freedom, and with what aid
they could extend surely only a few minutes
would be needed to accomplish it.
</p>
<p>
Even as he thought thus, he felt his hand violently
thrust back. At the same moment there
was the sound of heavy voices in the cabin.
Evidently one or both of the tramps must have
entered the second room and discovered Jerry
on his knees engaged in tunneling out.
</p>
<p>
There was no sound of a blow struck. Had
there been, Frank could never have contained
himself, but regardless of consequences must
have rushed around to where the door lay, and
burst into the place.
</p>
<p>
As it was, he backed away and joined his
comrades, who, it can easily be understood, were
more than curious to know what all this meant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is he in there?” demanded Bluff, close to the
ear of his chum.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I whispered his name and he answered
by saying mine,” came the thrilling reply.
</p>
<p>
“Good! good! let’s storm the measly old
rookery, and hold up those hoboes at the muzzle
of our guns. We’ve got the men, and we’ve got
the guns!” said Bluff; but his comrade drew him
down again ere he could rush forth.
</p>
<p>
“Wait! Be cool. This is no time to make
mistakes. I thought of that, but they’ve shut
the cabin door. Perhaps they begin to suspect
some of us are around. It may be they even
heard Jerry whisper my name. All we want to
do is to see that they do him no injury. After
a while the sheriff will be along to take care of
these jail-birds, all right,” Frank went on.
</p>
<p>
He said no more, because they once again
began to move farther away from the cabin walls.
There was a chance, however, that one of the
ferocious inmates might come out to investigate
the conditions, so Frank did not want to go so
far that he could not hold the fellow up and
cause a surrender.
</p>
<p>
“What can we do now?” asked Bluff, as they
crouched in a thick jungle, with the cabin lying
on their left, and only some twenty paces off.
</p>
<p>
“Watch and wait. If one of them comes out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
we’ll make him a prisoner. The door is there,
and no one is likely to escape us. Keep ready
for a quick move, both of you,” whispered Frank
in return.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I saw something moving up in that big
tree—the one that is half dead,” came from Tom
just then.
</p>
<p>
“Where at in the tree?” demanded Frank,
ready to examine into anything that happened to
come before their attention, no matter how odd.
</p>
<p>
“Say just where that gaping hole lies—about
ten feet up. The blame thing’s hollow, that’s
a cinch, and some critter’s got a nest in it. Maybe
an owl, but I’d rather believe ’twas a cat, or
perhaps a real b’ar. Looky, there she is again!”
</p>
<p>
Each of them had his eyes glued upon the
spot indicated in his low-toned communication
by the ex-cowboy. There certainly was something
moving, for while the light was not very
strong at that particular place, still they could see
an object projected from the gap.
</p>
<p>
Quickly it pushed farther out, and there
dawned upon their startled vision the same ape-like
creature that had terrorized the camp of
Pet Peters’ crowd on the previous night. It
seemed, as near as they could judge in that uncertain
light, to be covered with hair, just as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
a chimpanzee would be, and its face was in keeping
with the remainder of its hideous form.
</p>
<p>
Bluff and Tom crouched there and shivered
as they watched this awesome figure scramble
down from its perch by the aid of the broken
dead limbs. It dropped lightly on the ground
with a grunt, and then scurried off through the
undergrowth.
</p>
<p>
Tom gave a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“It’s gone, and I’m mighty near the stampedin’
point myself,” he admitted.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it was that wild man, as sure as fate.
Oh! how Will must carry on when he knows I
had such a <em>glorious</em> chance to get him, and lacked
the nerve,” whispered Bluff, still shaking with
excitement, or something else.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just as good you didn’t,” snickered
Frank; “for the sound would have betrayed us
to the chaps in the cabin.”
</p>
<p>
“You seem to be tickled about something—suppose
you tell a fellow what you see funny
about that awful monster? I’d like to laugh too,
but I declare if my lips ain’t frozen stiff. Is it a
wild man, or a beast? Why, I tell you his body
is covered with reddish hair, and his face, will I
ever get it out of my mind?”
</p>
<p>
Bluff was plainly much excited, but Frank
seemed quite cool.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. Later on I may tell you something
I’ve thought of. But he’s gone, I suppose,
and we can consider the cabin again,” replied
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Why not rush it? Given a log, and I vow
Tom and I can knock in that old door just like
you’d smash an egg,” pleaded the impatient Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“That would be poor policy. In the first
place those are desperate men, who are wanted
for robbery, and they know the jail is fairly itching
to hold them. Consequently they’re ready
to take all sorts of chances before giving up. I
wouldn’t put it past them to fire on us, to wound,
at least, if not worse.”
</p>
<p>
“But look here, they haven’t got any guns,
have they?” demanded Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“We only guessed that they hadn’t, but we
can’t be sure. Such ugly customers are hardly
likely to go without some means of defense, and
Tom here will back me up in that. Besides,
they’ve certainly got our chum,” declared Frank,
seriously.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you’re right, Frank, but I’d be willing
myself to take all the chances in a mix-up
with that crowd,” grumbled poor Bluff, who
always seemed to be close upon the border of
an opportunity to do something, only to have the
glorious prize snatched from his hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
He looked longingly toward the lonely cabin,
as though he yearned to have a shy at that
ricketty door. According to his mind, once
it was down those tramps would be only too glad
to throw up their hands, just as Pet Peters and
his crowd had done when he covered them on
the lake.
</p>
<p>
Frank himself hardly knew what action to
take.
</p>
<p>
“If I only thought they wouldn’t take it out
on poor Jerry, I’d be tempted to let Bluff work
his bold little trick. But I’m afraid. I know
what such men can do, with a long prison term
staring them in the face. Some of them would
just as soon he hung for a sheep as a lamb,” he
muttered.
</p>
<p>
“Do you really think they’d hurt Jerry?” asked
Bluff, solicitously.
</p>
<p>
“What do you know of that Waddy Walsh?”
</p>
<p>
“He was always a cruel chap, that’s a fact.
I’ve known him to torture a dog in a terrible
way. That was really why he was sent away.
Nobody could do anything with him; even the
town authorities had to give up the job,” replied
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“There you are, then. Now, he’s hitched up
with a rascal much worse than himself, from all
accounts. Think of those bold robberies all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
around. I tell you that pair make a desperate
team, and I shiver to think of what they could
do to Jerry if hard pushed. Perhaps, after all,
we’d better——”
</p>
<p>
What Frank was about to suggest was never
spoken. Tom Somers jerked his arm to signify
that he had better cease whispering; and as
Frank twisted his head around to see what had
happened to alarm their new comrade, he discovered
moving figures approaching from the
same quarter they had themselves come out of.
</p>
<p>
His first thought was that Sheriff Dodd had
arrived with his posse. Indeed, it was only with
a supreme effort that he refrained from leaping
to his feet and wildly beckoning. Then he was
glad he had been guilty of no such foolish act, for
he learned that this was far from being the truth.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve come back!” exclaimed Tom, in a
low tone, yet plainly disturbed; “looks like they
wanted to make sure of me, and had follered
us here so as to corral me!”
</p>
<p>
Then Frank understood. The flight of Pet
Peters and his followers had been, after all, something
of a bluff, for they had again left the
western shore and landed on Wildcat Island;
more than that, they were even now creeping
toward the cabin, as if bent upon some desperate
undertaking!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX—THE ESCAPE OF JERRY</h2>
<p>
“One, two, three, four!”
</p>
<p>
Frank was counting the shadowy figures that
came flitting closer, stooping over as they advanced,
some carrying cudgels, and others different
kinds of weapons as if they expected trouble
presently.
</p>
<p>
“Five, six—what, seven, yes, and eight!
Where did they pick up the other two members
of the crowd?” he was saying to himself as he
gazed from his snug retreat.
</p>
<p>
Then he noticed that a couple were armed with
guns. This gave him a clue which he easily followed
to a logical conclusion. On the western
shore of the lake Pet and his disgruntled followers
must have run across a couple of their cronies,
who were apparently out hunting, though the
law allowed of no shooting of game at this time
of year.
</p>
<p>
These fellows may even have been acting with
the sheriff, who had offered a certain reward for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
the apprehension of the hobo thieves. Upon exchanging
stories it may have been decided to
return to the island in a bunch, and make a bold
attempt to round up the tramps, who were believed
to be without any guns. That reward
would look big in the eyes of these fellows.
</p>
<p>
No doubt the presence of the old cabin was
known to these boys, and they had guessed that
their quarry might be found hiding there in the
heart of the jungle.
</p>
<p>
Frank laughed to himself at this new complication.
It began to look as if Waddy and his pal
would soon be between a lot of fires that must
scorch them, whichever way they turned.
</p>
<p>
He put a hand cautiously on Bluff. That individual
was so impulsive there could be no telling
just how he might act, and this touch would
serve to calm him down.
</p>
<p>
The flitting figures had now all passed the hiding
boys, avoiding the dense thicket in which
they were crouching, as there were easier passages
around. Looking out, Frank could see
them moving around the cabin, as if trying to
ascertain some weak place where an entrance
could be effected.
</p>
<p>
“Huh!” grunted Bluff, a little incautiously it
seemed, “they’re going to do what I wanted to
try—make an entrance. Some of them have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
gone to pick up that log, and others are peeking
in at the window, where the hay sticks out. If
it was bigger they’d just like to crawl through.
And we sit here like a set of babies. Huh!”
</p>
<p>
“Hold up, now, and consider. What’s to
hinder our letting them do the work, and then
when they go to reap the results we can just
step up and take the plum away,” cautioned his
comrade.
</p>
<p>
“I see. Like the monkey that got the cat to
pull his hot chestnuts out of the fire, eh? Talk
about Jerry being a lawyer, he ain’t in the same
class with you, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“Watch!” was all the other replied to this
shower of bouquets.
</p>
<p>
“Something’s going to happen to them fellers
around there before they know it,” remarked
Tom Somers, grimly, though, of course, he followed
the example of the others and kept his
voice down to the lowest possible notch.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you say that?” asked Bluff,
always eager for information.
</p>
<p>
“I seen something poking up along the roof.
I reckon one of them hoboes is going to come out
up thar, and drop something down on Pet and
the fellers. Gee! but don’t I hope he slams it
in hard. It’d make my cuts sting a heap less if
I see them guys have to take to the tall timber.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
Tom was feeling vindictive, and really, after
having seen his bruises, and remembering how
shabbily he had been treated by his pards, Frank
could hardly blame him for such a desire. Tom
was only human, after all.
</p>
<p>
Still, what he had said aroused the curiosity
of both Frank and Bluff. They riveted their
attention upon the roof of the cabin. As stated
before, this being badly dilapidated, the hoboes
had spent some time patching the same the best
they knew how.
</p>
<p>
It was even now in a shaky condition, and apt
to give way if any daring soul ventured to put
his weight upon it.
</p>
<p>
At least Tom was right, for they quickly discovered
that a certain portion of this roof was
actually moving, and even as they looked what
seemed to be a human arm was thrust through.
Some one was evidently making an opening, removing
the pieces one by one at a place where
they had been fastened across a former hole.
</p>
<p>
Frank felt that there was something more
about this than appeared on the surface. He
also noted that the fellows on the ground had
by now become aware that they were apparently
about to be menaced from above; for he saw
them crouching down under the spot from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
whence the pieces were falling, their eyes turned
upward.
</p>
<p>
Then a head was finally thrust up through the
opening. Bluff gasped again. It seemed as
though he were bound to get shock after shock.
</p>
<p>
“Get next to that, will you?” he whispered
in Frank’s ear, as he clutched his sleeve and
jerked hard; “why, it’s our chum Jerry! Oh!
ain’t he the candy kid, though?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” said the other, giving him a push, to
keep him from rising in his excitement.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I take off my lid to him, anyway,”
whimpered Bluff, unable to give proper expression
to his feelings.
</p>
<p>
The boy whose actions they were watching
seemed to have made up his mind that he must
get out of that cabin some way or other. He
had been halted in his tunneling operations, and
perhaps there was some reason why he might
not resume them, or try and open the door; but
Jerry evidently could not be held in restraint.
</p>
<p>
It was possible that his captors were dozing,
and, taking advantage of the opportunity, he was
about to quit their company by means of the hole
he had made in the roof.
</p>
<p>
Now his body had appeared. He was testing
the rotten timbers first to make positive that
they would hold him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
Bluff hardly breathed as he stared as well as
he could, for it was half dark here, even in the
daytime. He knew that a mutual surprise
awaited all the persons taking part in that little
drama, when Jerry reached the edge and looked
over. Those crouching below expected to see
one of the tattered hoboes, while possibly Jerry
hoped he might find his chums awaiting him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s coming!” Frank heard him say, as he
fumbled around for something; but he was so
much interested himself that he did not give
Bluff a second thought.
</p>
<p>
Then the creeping boy on the low roof of the
cabin reached the edge. They saw him stretch
his neck so that his head projected over; and
there he remained, as if frozen stiff by the
strange sight that greeted him.
</p>
<p>
It was not so gloomy there alongside the
shack but that his keen eyes could see, under the
heavy growth of rank trees, the many faces up-turned
toward him. At the same time, Pet and
his mates made the astounding discovery that
it was Jerry Wallington, after all, who had been
about to descend in this peculiar way.
</p>
<p>
Too late, Frank realized what was coming.
He heard the old familiar “click” close to his
ear, and a thrill of alarm shot through his frame;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
but ere he could even wink, much less make the
slightest movement, the thing was done.
</p>
<p>
Bluff had fired another cartridge connected
with that camera of Will’s. Recognizing the
proper elements for a powerful flashlight picture
in the remarkable combination before him, he
had proceeded to carry out Will’s instructions,
regardless of consequences.
</p>
<p>
Some of the clustering boys seemed ready to
scamper off, but the voice of Pet recalled them
to a sense of their duty. Besides, the prospect
of becoming lost in those gloomy woods was not
very flattering, and they huddled together.
</p>
<p>
“Hey, don’t yuh let that skeer yuh, fellers.
It’s on’y some of that crazy Will Milton’s photergraphy
business. Stick to it, and get that reward.
Don’t a single one of yuh dar’ to run!” was what
he shouted.
</p>
<p>
The situation was rather embarrassing for
Jerry. He seemed to be between two fires as it
were. If he came down, these angry boys stood
ready to attack him; while to stay where he was
meant that the hoboes would be able to reach
him.
</p>
<p>
Frank began to wonder whether the time had
not come for them to enter the game and stand
by their chum. He had even arisen to his feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
to make a forward movement when he saw that
as usual, Jerry had his wits about him.
</p>
<p>
The boy on the quivering roof of the old
shack was edging his way along. He appeared
to be aiming for a certain spot where a big tree
swept its branches down so as to brush the roof.
</p>
<p>
It offered a refuge for any one who could
neither come down nor remain where he was,
and Jerry knew he could make it. Now he
reached the nearest limb, and like a monkey
scrambled upward. The one who caught him
after that would have to be nimble indeed.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah!” shouted Bluff, unable to restrain
his admiration for the presence of mind on the
part of his chum.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, given time, and the Peters crowd
might have attempted some further hostile move,
looking to the capture of the boy who had just
gained his freedom from a prison. Frank was
grimly making up his mind that, no matter what
happened, he did not mean to stand idly by and
see Jerry fall into the hands of these fellows.
</p>
<p>
“Say, are you going to rush ’em?” demanded
Bluff, fairly wild to make a charge.
</p>
<p>
“Not unless they start after Jerry. Just now
they seem to be bent on capturing our friends,
the hoboes, and we can afford to let them fight it
out until both sides are exhausted, when our time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
will come. There they go at the door with the
log as a battering ram! Whoop! what do you
think of that?”
</p>
<p>
Frank’s last exclamation was caused by a sudden
movement on the part of the besieged; for
the door had suddenly opened, and a pan of hot
water was thrown out on the huddled holders
of the log.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI—THE LAST STRAW</h2>
<p>
“Ouch! I’m scalded!”
</p>
<p>
“Skidoo, boys! there’s more a-comin’!”
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t ye shoot, Bill, when ye had the
chance? Gee! the skin’s a-peelin’ off me nose
a’ready!”
</p>
<p>
No sooner had Waddy Walsh thrown the pan
of hot water upon the advancing group that
carried the log than he bolted inside again, and
the bar was heard falling back of the door.
</p>
<p>
Then they heard the young savage laugh loud
and long. It was this sound that aroused the
passions of the crowd. They no longer thought
of flight. With the burning sensation that came
with the hot water application, each fellow ached
to be revenged. The worst of it was, most of
them knew Waddy well, and indeed he had once
been a member of this same crowd.
</p>
<p>
Down went the log to the ground. All thought
of using it as a battering ram had left them now.
</p>
<p>
“Git behind the trees, fellers. It’s us to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
foolish house if we let that Waddy Walsh ketch
us ag’in,” shouted Pet, who was rubbing his face
quite as vigorously as his comrades in misery.
</p>
<p>
Upon this they hustled for shelter. Each boy
took to a tree that happened to come handy, and
feeling safe from a further bombardment they
gave vent to their feelings in all sorts of characteristic
shouts.
</p>
<p>
Frank was feeling a bit anxious about Jerry.
What if these reckless spirits, aggravated by
their hot reception, should try to take it out on
the person of the boy they hated? Two of them
carried some manner of shotguns, and there was
no telling what they might not be tempted to do.
</p>
<p>
When, however, he looked anxiously up into
the tree where he had last seen Jerry, to his
delight he found that the other had vanished
completely from sight.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s he gone?” asked Bluff, at this moment,
he having apparently likewise just discovered
the absence of the other chum.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. Perhaps he’s only hiding behind
the trunk of the tree, or he may have found
it hollow, like that other one, and slipped in.
Watch what those fellows are up to. If they
make a move to shoot at Jerry, we’ll have to put
in our oar,” Frank answered with considerable
feeling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
Pet Peters’ crowd was plainly at a loss to know
how they ought to proceed. They saw that hundred
dollars reward dangling temptingly before
their eyes, and could not bear the thought of
letting it pass without straining themselves to
the utmost to win it. All sorts of things they
had wanted so long could be bought with that
easy money, and they were not yet ready to give
up their chances.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! Bill, you an’ Sim git over here. I wanter
have a spiel with yuh. Them guns orter fetch
our game out on ther knees, if yuh on’y use ’em
steady. Kim over, an’ you, too, Miser Lee.
P’raps I kin use yuh!”
</p>
<p>
It was Pet bawling out, and that his word
carried weight was manifest by the way in which
the three fellows addressed hastened to cross over
to where he stood back of the big tree that had the
gaping hole in its trunk ten feet from the ground.
</p>
<p>
Frank could see them talking earnestly, and
gesticulating as if to emphasize their words.
Finally Pet seized the gun that one of the others
carried, and taking a quick aim at the cabin he
pulled the trigger.
</p>
<p>
“Bang! bang!” went both barrels.
</p>
<p>
The dead grass vanished from the little
window under the charges of shot at such close
quarters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“Kim out o’ that, an’ surrender to the law!”
bellowed Pet.
</p>
<p>
Frank laughed to himself at the words; it was
more than comical to hear this boy, whose contempt
for law and order had made him a marked
character in Centerville, so loudly proclaim his
sudden conversion.
</p>
<p>
Silence followed this peremptory command.
Those within the cabin either did not care to
answer, or else could not.
</p>
<p>
“Say, Pet, p’raps ye did for ’em that time?”
suggested one of the others.
</p>
<p>
“Git out! Thar wa’nt no chance of that happenin’.
Waddy just wants tuh fool us. He allers
was that ways, yuh know,” answered Pet; but
it was plain that the awful suggestion rather
awed him.
</p>
<p>
“Shall I shoot, Pet?” asked the other owner of
a gun, dubiously.
</p>
<p>
“’Course yuh must. Think I’m goin’ tuh do
all the work. Blaze away both of ye, so long as
ye got a shell left. Anyhow, p’raps we kin put
in a claim fur part o’ the reward, fur holdin’ ’em
here. Go on, Sim, I tell yuh!”
</p>
<p>
So Sim began to bombard the wall of the cabin.
He made mighty sure not to fire in at that little
gaping hole where the dead grass had hung until
Pet knocked it through with his shot. If so be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
any damage was done to the inmates Sim did not
mean to be accused as the guilty one.
</p>
<p>
Things seemed pretty lively for a time, with
those two guns rattling away as fast as the
owners could reload. From behind their trees
the balance of the attacking crowd watched to see
if there came any white flag of surrender. Beyond
the boom of the guns, however, not a
sound was heard, unless the excited voices of
the eager boys were taken into consideration.
</p>
<p>
Bluff was plainly nervous. He tried to get
up several times, and as often Frank pulled him
down again.
</p>
<p>
“I just can’t stand it, with all that racket going
on. Why don’t we have a share in it?” he
begged, piteously.
</p>
<p>
“Because we don’t want to expose our hand.
Give those silly chumps time and they will play
the game to suit us. Wait till their last shell
has been fired; then we control the situation.
See?” whispered his comrade, soothingly.
</p>
<p>
“Frank, you hit me again that time. What
a goose I am. Why, of course that’s the racket
for us. Let ’em go on and roll their hoop!”
answered Bluff, who at least was always ready
to admit the error of his ways when convinced.
</p>
<p>
The shooting soon came to an end, for neither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
Sim nor Bill seemed to have any great amount of
ammunition with them.
</p>
<p>
“That’s my last shell!” declared the former,
presently.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I got my last in the gun. Shall I use
’em, Pet?” demanded the other.
</p>
<p>
“’Course, an’ send it in the windy this time,”
growled the one addressed.
</p>
<p>
But Bill was too shrewd for that, and proceeded
to sprinkle his bird shot over the surface
of the ancient logs.
</p>
<p>
“Now we control the situation. Our guns are
not useless, if theirs are!” exclaimed Frank, with
a chuckle.
</p>
<p>
Still he did not seem in any hurry to open hostilities.
Perhaps he hoped these eight followers
of Pet might find a way to capture the hoboes,
upon which they could appear on the scene and
menace the enemy until they were glad to run
away, leaving the fruits of their victory in the
hands of Frank and his friends.
</p>
<p>
“Pet’s up to something tricky. I bet it’s the
old game of firing the shanty. You remember,
Frank, how he tried to burn us out last Fall
when we were in camp. There goes some of the
lot creeping up with armfuls of leaves. Say, are
we going to stand by and see it done?” queried
Bluff, warmly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
“At the last minute we can stop it. When
Pet starts up to strike a match, then we’ll take
a hand. No hurry. The chaps inside won’t
thank us, remember. It’s out of the frying-pan
into the fire with them,” came from his companion,
who was observing all that went on
with a critical eye.
</p>
<p>
“Looks like they meant to have a big enough
pile of leaves there,” said Bluff, as the line of
creeping forms kept depositing more and more
fuel close to the wall of the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and I reckon she’d burn like tinder if
once started. Suppose those two hoboes rushed
out suddenly, do you suppose Pet and his crowd
have got sand enough to tackle them?” asked
Frank of the recruit on his other side.
</p>
<p>
“They want that reward bad, I reckon, and
would do some tall fightin’ to get it. Fightin’ is
ther main suit, ye know,” answered Tom Somers,
as he caressed the cut on his face tenderly.
</p>
<p>
“Now they’ve stopped piling up the leaves.
Looks like they expected Pet to go in and put
a match to the bunch. He don’t appear to hanker
after the job, but to back out would put him on
the blink with the crowd. There, Frank, he’s
going to make the riffle, you see. Now, what?”
panted Bluff, again seeking to rise, as he fumbled
his gun nervously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s no need of our doing anything, after
all,” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Then you mean to let ’em set the cabin on
fire, and perhaps roast the poor hoboes before
our very eyes?” exclaimed Bluff, in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“Not at all. I only mean that the job of
frightening the bunch off is going to be taken
out of our hands, for that wild man is coming
back!”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say? Where—point him out to
me, Frank. Oh! if I could only get a chance
to snap him off; but, just like the luck, the last
flashlight cartridge is gone. Ginger! I see him
now. Ain’t he a terror though? And won’t they
go into fits when he rushes ’em? There he comes,
as sure as you live! Wow! watch the circus,
boys. My! my! ain’t I glad I’m here to see this!”
</p>
<p>
Tom Somers had said that his former teammates
loved nothing better than a fight, but there
were evidently times when such a condition of
affairs was far from their thoughts. Such
seemed to be the case now, for as they heard
the shrill whoops of the outlandish hairy figure
that came prancing headlong toward them, every
boy took to his heels in a mad flight, heedless
alike of direction or obstacles in the way, so long
as he could escape a close encounter with that
terrible creature.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII—HOLDING THE FORT</h2>
<p>
“Look at them run, Frank! Such a scared
crowd of singed cats! Did you ever see such a
sight? But where is that old wild man gone?”
exclaimed Bluff, who had arisen fearlessly to
his feet the better to watch the mad flight of
Pet Peters and his cronies through the dense
thickets.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t say, Bluff. I was too much taken
up with the way some of those boys banged headlong
into the trunks of trees to notice anything
else. Did you see, Tom?”
</p>
<p>
“He climbed the same old tree, and popped
into that hole like a jack-in-the-box,” declared
the one addressed, quickly.
</p>
<p>
At that Frank laughed again and again, though
Bluff looked at him as if hardly understanding
what there was about the manner of the wild
man’s disappearance to amuse his chum so.
</p>
<p>
“Jerry!” he called presently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about that, will you?” a familiar
voice said, and they saw the object of their solicitude
clambering down from a tree not far away
from the house.
</p>
<p>
In another minute the three chums were shaking
hands with a vim. It was certainly good to
see Jerry again, and Bluff could hardly keep from
embracing him.
</p>
<p>
“Did they treat you mean, old pard?” he asked,
looking darkly toward the cabin, as if meditating
an immediate assault if Jerry complained.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it wasn’t a nice experience, I tell you;
but on the whole they didn’t kick me more than
a dozen times, and I reckon I sassed ’em enough
to expect that. Glad to see you again, fellows,
I tell you. Who’s this? Hello! what’s Tom
Somers doing with chums of mine, I’d like to
know?” demanded the escaped captive, curiously.
</p>
<p>
“He had a fight with the rest, and they left
him on the island, tied to a tree?” explained
Bluff, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh; yes, I see, and you rescued him, so that
out of gratitude he joined forces to storm the
stronghold of the common enemy. Say, this
beats anything we ever met up with. That wild
man is sure the greatest thing that ever came
over the pike,” and to Bluff’s surprise Jerry also
had a fit of laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“You fellows seem to be tickled over something
that I don’t just grab. I didn’t think you
were the kind to laugh at a poor, silly fool that
has escaped from the asylum, and imagines, perhaps,
he’s Father Adam in the woods,” he complained.
</p>
<p>
At which remark the others had another burst
of laughter. Frank looked at Jerry, made a
gesture with his head, and placed his finger on
his lips to indicate silence, upon seeing which,
Jerry nodded and grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Tell us about your experiences, will you?”
asked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Only a few words. The rest will have to
keep until we’re settled around the fire in camp,”
returned Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“But we have no camp, now,” retorted Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“What’s happened? Did those criminals burn
you out, boys?” asked the other, with clenched
hands; for he had a few things he prized among
the traps they had carried along with them, and
the loss of which would be deeply regretted.
</p>
<p>
“No, but we decided that while off hunting
for you we couldn’t leave Will there alone; so
we dug up stakes, piled the ‘duffle’ in the canoes,
and he’s off somewhere on the lake waiting a
signal to land again,” remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Great scheme. I can guess in whose brain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
it originated. But you don’t know how bully it
is to see you again, fellows. Hang it, if it doesn’t
seem like a month since I saw you last. And as
to feed, I’ve just had a few things pushed into
my mouth as if I were a bird in a nest. I’m
just longing for a decent meal again.”
</p>
<p>
“What happened while I was examining that
Indian mound?” asked Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I was dozing when something landed like a
thousand of brick on my chest. For the life of
me I couldn’t say a single word. I guess I must
have fainted, though perhaps I ought to be
ashamed to admit it. Next thing I knew I was
being toted off on the shoulders of the big tramp,
a fellow called Biffins, who, I expect must be
a yeggman, because he seemed to know all about
blowing open safes in country stores, and such
things,” went on Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Just to think of it, and carrying you on his
shoulders like a log!” palpitated Bluff, listening
with eagerness to these disclosures.
</p>
<p>
“They fetched me here to this cabin, and kept
me tied up part of the time. That night was a
long horror to me. Sometimes they were in
with me, and again off somewhere. In the morning
I saw that they had made a raise of some
provisions, and it was then they fed me like a
baby.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you got your hands free after a while,
didn’t you?” asked Bluff, too anxious to wait
until the other reached this point.
</p>
<p>
“To be sure, and commenced that tunnel.
You see, the hole in the wall was too small to
crawl through, and they were in the other room
where the door lay. When I caught hold of a
hand I seemed to guess instantly that it must
belong to one of you fellows, and then the signal
squeeze told me so. Biffins caught me just then,
and threw me aside. They filled up the hole and
drove some stakes down alongside so I couldn’t
tunnel any more. After that I thought of the
old roof, for it was full of holes. So I climbed
up and got out that way.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry showed by his actions that he did not
wish to talk any longer on the score of his adventures.
He kept looking toward the cabin
suggestively.
</p>
<p>
“What do we do now, fellows? Want to trek
back to the shore and leave these two in peace?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Not for me,” answered Bluff, readily enough;
“I say that after the way they held you a prisoner
it’s our duty to turn the tables on the rascals.
We’ve got ’em in a hole, and all we have to do
is to wait until Mr. Dodd comes.”
</p>
<p>
Jerry glanced inquiringly toward Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we heard whistles a bit ago, and imagine
the posse must have landed. If we could
only communicate with them in some way now,
and get them to come here, we might hold the
fort meanwhile.”
</p>
<p>
Frank looked at Tom Somers as he spoke.
The other could not mistake his meaning.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! I’ll go, all right, if so be you write a
little note to the sheriff. Him an’ me ain’t on
the best terms, I reckon,” grinned that worthy.
</p>
<p>
“Done. Got a pencil with you, Bluff—mine
seems to have disappeared.”
</p>
<p>
The pencil being forthcoming, Frank dashed
off a few lines to Mr. Dodd, and signed his name.
</p>
<p>
“Sure you can get to the beach, Tom?” he
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Easy as fallin’ off a log. I’m off, then,
fellers.”
</p>
<p>
Saying which, Tom entered the bush, and disappeared
from view.
</p>
<p>
“Now, what is the programme?” asked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Wasn’t that a boat whistle again? It seemed
to come from another quarter, too?” remarked
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“I heard it, all right. Perhaps the tug is
circling the island so as to make sure the thieves
get no chance to make off,” suggested Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“You’re right, that is just what their programme must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
be. Meanwhile they’ve landed the
posse to search the whole place over. I hope
Tom meets up with them in good time,” continued
Frank, earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“There’s somebody shouting in the woods,”
remarked Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! that’s the Peters tribe trying to get together
again. Reminds me of a covey of quail
that has been flushed and scattered, calling to
each other from the brush,” laughed Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Will they come back here again?” Bluff continued.
</p>
<p>
The others exchanged looks, and chuckles
followed.
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your sprinters, I don’t think
you could hire any one of those same chaps to
come within fifty yards of this place after the
scare they got!” exclaimed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“And the dose of hot water in the bargain.
My! but they must feel sore! I saw several
bang headlong into trees as they galloped away.
There will be some lumps as big as goose-eggs
among that crowd to-night. And, after all, they
don’t get even a look-in on that prize money,”
chuckled Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got a proposition, fellows. If the reward
should happen to come our way I move we turn
it over to Tom Somers. His family is poor, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
perhaps this may be the turning point in Tom’s
life, who knows?” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Hear! hear! Them’s my sentiments!” cried
the impulsive Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Ditto,” echoed Jerry; for since they all belonged
to families of wealth the promise of a
reward held no attraction for Frank and his
chums.
</p>
<p>
“But perhaps if we simply hold these chaps
where they are the sheriff may claim he did the
bagging of the game; how about that?” asked
Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“You mean we ought to try and make them
surrender to us?”
</p>
<p>
“If it could be done. I’ve got an idea in my
head. You’ll say it isn’t original, and perhaps
the trick they were going to play may have had
something to do with it. But suppose they made
a sneak while we talked here and left us to hold
the bag?”
</p>
<p>
“No danger of that, Bluff, while we keep a
watch on the door. Presently we can circle
around the old rookery and make sure that they
don’t take up your plan of tunneling out. Jerry,
I’m going to keep an eye on this tree with the
hole in it. If our friend, the wild man, ventures
forth, it shall be my pleasant task to hold him
up. What do you say?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
Bluff looked at Frank as he made this remark,
with uneasiness in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me you ain’t afraid of anything,
Frank. That crazy man gets on my nerves, and
I don’t think I could stand for a tussle with
him at close quarters. Better be careful how
you let him get hold of you. They say these
lunatics are just as strong as grizzly bears, and
this one must be, to see the way he swung about
in that tree like a big ape. Ugh! Excuse me!”
</p>
<p>
Bluff shuddered as he spoke, and consequently
did not see the look that passed between his two
chums, and which was more of amusement than
concern.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII—THE WHITE FLAG</h2>
<p>
“What time of day is it?” asked Jerry presently.
</p>
<p>
He had evidently lost all track of time while
a prisoner in the cabin.
</p>
<p>
“Just ten o’clock,” replied Frank. “What’s
become of your watch, pard?”
</p>
<p>
“Decorating the vest of Waddy, just now,
though I have hopes of wearing it again after
he’s tired of it,” grinned Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Hope we get fixed up again before night. I’m
thinking all the while of a bully camp dinner.
Say, wasn’t this the day the girls promised to
come over and bring us some home grub?” asked
Bluff suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Just as you say, and they’ll be along this
afternoon on schedule time. Too bad if they have
that long row for nothing. I expected to have
dinner waiting for them when they got here, and
then we could take them home in the canoes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
This rumpus has upset all our plans,” remarked
Frank dismally; for secretly, Violet Milton had
promised to cook a dish that was an especial
favorite of his and bring it over, to prove her
accomplishments in the culinary line.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I hope it may all turn out right yet. Now,
that reminds me of my plan. If we could only
force these two rascals to surrender it would
shorten our stay out in the bush, and we could
make for the beach, call Will ashore, and have
our tents up again in a jiffy.”
</p>
<p>
“Talk to me about your persistent youngsters,
ain’t he all to the good, though? What is this
jim-dandy plan of yours, Bluff? Suppose you
give us a look-in, so we can cheer you on, or
condemn it as altogether too ridiculous?” suggested
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Smoke!”
</p>
<p>
“You mean, make it so uncomfortable for the
hoboes that they’ll be glad to come out and hold
up their little hands for us—is that the programme?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t you think it would work, Jerry?”
demanded the originator.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s going to do the smoking act? Tell
me that.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s easy. Count on me, if you don’t mind
holding my gun while I chase around and gather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
some stuff that will smolder and not blaze up.
Some green weeds make a bitter smoke that
smarts the eyes dreadfully. I’ll try that on.
Those tramps may be able to stand for a good
deal, but if they stay in that place long they’ll
feel like a couple of smoked hams,” declared the
energetic Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, so far as that goes, I’m only too willing
to grab a good old gun again. I reckon you let
Will have mine,” observed Jerry as he relieved
the other of the repeating shotgun.
</p>
<p>
“And you won’t feel disgraced because it happens
to be one of those pump-guns?” Bluff took
occasion to remark, maliciously.
</p>
<p>
“Circumstances alter cases. This is one. I’ve
no doubt that a gun like this can be very useful
at times. Anyhow, I’m open to a trial. Just
let those hoboes show up and try to attack us,
and if I don’t fill their miserable bodies full of
bird shot, then it’s twenty-three for mine. Now,
watch him begin his new job, Frank.”
</p>
<p>
“You saw what happened to those other boys
when they started to rush the door with that
log battering-ram, didn’t you, Bluff? Perhaps
they’ve got more hot water handy. Look out
for it, my son,” warned Frank.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m onto that racket. I can dodge any
Niagara that comes. Besides, I don’t mean to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
give ’em more of a chance at me than I can help.
One of you keep watch on the door, and if they
start to open just bang away in the air to tell
that we mean business. Here goes, boys.”
</p>
<p>
So Bluff commenced moving hither and thither
under the trees, searching for just the kind of
wood he wanted. It was his intention to start
his fire alongside the tree that grew nearest to
the cabin wall. Then, after he had it smoking at
a furious rate he could push the whole mass
under the structure with a long stick.
</p>
<p>
For some time he worked. Not a sound or a
sign of life came from the cabin. If Waddy
Walsh and his pal, Biffins, were still inside, they
knew how to keep quiet.
</p>
<p>
By this time our friends had become convinced
that the hobo couple could not be in possession
of any kind of firearm, for they would surely
have made some use of the same at the time
Pet Peters and his crowd pushed them so warmly.
</p>
<p>
Feeling sure of this, Bluff worked openly, only
keeping behind the trees whenever he approached
close to the hut, for fear lest a sudden shower of
scalding fluid should greet him.
</p>
<p>
Frank and Jerry had separated, each watching
a side of the cabin. Frank also kept close to the
tree which had sheltered the singular being whose
coming on the scene had completed the fright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
of Pet Peters and his cronies. From the way
he cast frequent looks up at that yawning cavity
it would seem as though he half anticipated a
reappearance of the remarkable creature that had
vanished inside the tree.
</p>
<p>
Finally Bluff seemed to have arranged the little
pile of material to suit.
</p>
<p>
“Here she goes, fellows! Look out, now!
There may be something doing. Hold ’em up
if they rush me!” he called, as he applied a
match.
</p>
<p>
The stuff burned briskly at first. When he had
allowed it to gain what headway he deemed sufficient,
Bluff began to cover the fire with the
green weeds brought for the purpose.
</p>
<p>
“Wow!” shouted Jerry, as a wavering breeze
carried some of the dense smoke over to his
station. “That’s the limit! Ought to be a State’s
prison offense for any one to make such a smudge
as that. You’ll suffocate the poor guys—that’s
what!”
</p>
<p>
But Bluff only grinned, and labored on. He
had a long pole in his hands, with which he
was shoving the smoldering mass over so that
it would pass under a certain part of the cabin.
Here there was a friendly opening ready to receive
it.
</p>
<p>
Bang! went a gun.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
The cabin door, which had started to open,
was hastily shut, although, of course, Jerry had
fired above the roof.
</p>
<p>
“How does it work?” shouted Bluff, thinking
more of his gun in the hands of the one who had
always detested it than his own danger from hot
water.
</p>
<p>
“Great!” answered Jerry as he let another shot
loose, having, as he thought, detected a movement
of the door again.
</p>
<p>
Thinking they had drawn his fangs, those in
the cabin now really opened the door, to get a
chance to deluge Bluff, when, to their amazement
and alarm, Jerry turned loose a third shot.
The door shut, this time to open no more for
that purpose.
</p>
<p>
“Now what do you say?” roared Bluff. “What
could you have done with one of your old measly
two-shot guns, eh? Tell me that.”
</p>
<p>
“I take back all I ever said against the bully
thing. Three more shots waiting for you, Mister
Hobo. Just show your nose, and see!” exclaimed
the marksman.
</p>
<p>
“Mark the window, Bluff!” called Frank just
then.
</p>
<p>
Thus warned in time, Bluff was able to scurry
around the protecting trunk of the tree as an
arm was projected from the small opening, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
as before, a pan of steaming water dashed all
around him.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about that, will you?” jeered Jerry,
who guessed what had happened, though it took
place on the other side of the cabin.
</p>
<p>
Bluff started pushing his mass of smoking
weeds forward again.
</p>
<p>
“Never touched me!” he shouted in his excitement.
</p>
<p>
By this time the rank smoke had begun to
ooze up through the floor of the old cabin. Doubtless
there were plenty of gaping cracks between
the puncheon boards to allow of a draught. Just
how long the inmates could stand this sickening
cloud was a question.
</p>
<p>
“Say! ain’t this the real thing? Perhaps the
sheriff would like to take a few lessons from
our chum Bluff on how to smoke hams. Listen,
will you! The poor guys are sneezing to beat
the band. Keep up the good work, pard, and
you’ll force their hand. Get ready to cover
’em, Frank. I reckon something’s bound to happen
soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Hey, you Waddy! Show up with the white
flag, and we quit!” called Bluff from behind his
refuge.
</p>
<p>
He was rubbing the back of his neck as he
spoke, for while he had claimed to have escaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
entirely, some of the splashing water had dropped
on his skin and left an impression in the shape
of a red mark.
</p>
<p>
“A white flag—that’s the game! Might as
well do it right while we’re at it, boys. Come
out, Waddy! We want you, and we mean to get
you! Three more charges in this elegant pump-gun,
and all for you. Do you surrender?” shouted
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
It was happiness to Bluff to hear this scoffing
sportsman chum of his thus praise the hitherto
detested repeating gun, and he danced around
almost recklessly, such was his delight.
</p>
<p>
But no more charges of scalding water belched
out of that small window. Perhaps the two unfortunates
within had all they could attend to
trying to breathe in that sickening, smoke-laden
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
“Keep up the good work, Bluff. It’s immense,”
encouraged Frank, who really believed that, after
all, the other had hit upon a clever way to force
a surrender on the part of the defiant hoboes.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly the energetic fireman gave a loud
cheer.
</p>
<p>
“They shove out the white flag! They surrender!
What d’ye think of my plan, now, fellows?
There’s Waddy waving it out of the window!
Don’t shoot the poor duck—he’s pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
near all in, and blind with the smoke!” he
whooped.
</p>
<p>
It was so.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the article that the boy tramp was
waving wildly out of the small opening may have
hardly deserved the name of white flag, but his
intentions could not be doubted.
</p>
<p>
Smoke had won against stubborn grit, and the
hoboes were ready to throw up their hands!
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV—A NEW ALARM</h2>
<p>
“Do you give up, Waddy?” demanded Frank,
menacingly holding his gun leveled.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we’ll hands up, all right. Both of us are
on the blink with the smoke, and nigh blind. Call
it off, fellers,” whined the owner of the dirty
face in the opening, while he coughed several
times to emphasize his words.
</p>
<p>
“All right, then. Now, tell Biffins that we
want him out first, and if he tries to run, it’s a
charge of bird shot for him in the rear. Get
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure. No danger of us doin’ anythin’. We’re
so near blind we couldn’t run if we wanted to.”
</p>
<p>
The head vanished. Ten seconds later the door
was thrown open and a big man staggered into
sight, reeling as if he were intoxicated. The
two fugitives had stubbornly stuck to the cabin
through all, until nearly dead for fresh air.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i004' id='i004'></a>
<img src="images/illus-212.jpg" alt="AS HE CAME, THE MAN HELD BOTH ARMS ALOFT." title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>AS HE CAME, THE MAN HELD BOTH ARMS ALOFT.</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>
As he came, the man held both arms aloft.
Apparently he knew what was wanted, and did
not mean to encourage these young hunters to
try a shot at his person.
</p>
<p>
“Lie down on the ground, on your face!” shouted
Frank. “Now keep your hands stretched out
that way. Don’t dare move, or it will be bad
for you, Biffins. Now, Waddy, your turn!”
called Frank again.
</p>
<p>
A second figure came into view, groping, as if
utterly blind. He, too, was compelled to drop
on the cool earth, where he could gulp in great
breaths of the fresh air, of which they were in
such dire need.
</p>
<p>
From three directions the boys approached.
</p>
<p>
“Hurrah! We bagged ’em!” shouted Bluff.
</p>
<p>
Frank said nothing. It was not in his nature
to exult over a fallen foe, though he did not
blame the more impulsive Bluff for his evident
delight.
</p>
<p>
From one of his pockets he produced some
stout cord. He certainly had never dreamed
what a singular use he would find for this when
placing it there.
</p>
<p>
“Watch them both, Jerry. Now, Biffins, put
your hands behind you, crossed. I’m going to
tie them so. It’s no use thinking of doing anything.
You couldn’t escape, even if you got away
from us, for the sheriff has this island surrounded,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
and he is on the way here, right now, with his
posse. Perhaps you might be shot down in the
woods. There, you won’t break that, I reckon,
in a hurry.”
</p>
<p>
He turned his attention to the second rascal.
Waddy Walsh had reached a point in his reckless
career where he did not care much what happened
to him. Having in a measure recovered
from the suffocating fumes of the smoking weeds,
he even twisted his head half way around to jeer
at Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Helpin’ to arrest your old pard, hey, Jerry?
That’s kind of you, now. I’ll be likely to remember
it, old feller, when I get out again,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you won’t have a chance to get out
in a hurry, Waddy. I’m ashamed to admit that
I did once go out with you, till you took to stealing,
and I had to cut you off my visiting list.
Hear that shooting, boys? The sheriff’s posse
must be in the woods nearby, right now, and
coming this way. I reckon Tom found ’em, all
right.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let ’em come. We’re ready to hand
the prisoners over to the lawful officers. Say,
but this has been a fierce time all around. We
never thought, when we started out to camp on
Wildcat Island, that we’d pass through such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
string of adventures. Where are you going,
Frank?” said Bluff, as the other started to enter
the cabin, the smoke having settled somewhat,
after the smoldering weeds were dragged away
from under the wall.
</p>
<p>
“Just to look around a little, that’s all. Please
stay with Jerry,” came the answer, as Frank vanished
within.
</p>
<p>
Presently he came out again. He had a bundle
under his arm, wrapped in a newspaper, and
of which he seemed especially careful. Jerry
looked at him, and received a nod in return, which
he seemed to understand full well, for he asked
no questions.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s the packet Mr. Pemberton lost, and
I suppose the valuables are all safe inside, eh,
Waddy?” he said, holding up something small
he carried.
</p>
<p>
“Never touched a thing in it. Them other
pieces of silver we swiped out of the farmhouse,
and anything else you find come from that storage
house over in Newtonport. We was after
something big there, but missed it,” admitted
the boy from the reform school, with unblushing
effrontery.
</p>
<p>
Loud calls were now heard close by. Bluff
lifted his tuneful voice and shouted:
</p>
<p>
“This way, Mr. Dodd. Everything lovely, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
the goose hangs high. We’ve got ’em safe and
sound. Here’s your men, sir. Step right up and
put the irons on ’em!”
</p>
<p>
Biffins had not said a word up to now. The
smoke had taken all desire to talk away from
him; but he proved that he could swear like a
pirate. No doubt what galled him most of all
was the fact that his capture had been brought
about through the instrumentality of a parcel
of boys.
</p>
<p>
The crashing of the undergrowth became plainer.
Then a party of men could be seen hurrying
forward as fast as the tangled thickets would
allow.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Dodd, the sheriff, was at their head. As
he saw the two tramp thieves lying on the ground,
helpless, he gave a roar. Rushing up to the boys,
he shook the hand of each one in turn.
</p>
<p>
“Bully work, boys! I’m proud to know you,
proud to say you live in the same town as I do!
Hello, Biffins! So it’s you, eh? Well, this time
we’ve got you dead to rights, and you don’t get
off. And here’s Waddy Walsh, broke loose from
the school he was sent to to learn to become a
decent man. Back you go, my fine lad, this time
to stay.”
</p>
<p>
So he rattled on, as he proceeded to clap a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
pair of neat steel bracelets on the wrists of each
of the prisoners.
</p>
<p>
After that he went into the cabin and thoroughly
searched it.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon we’ve got all the plunder they had,
and now it might be a good thing if we burned
this old rat trap of a nest to the ground. It’s
got a bad name, and if tramp thieves have taken
to lodging here, the sooner it goes, the better.”
</p>
<p>
Under the orders of the sheriff, some of the
posse started things moving. In a short time
the old cabin was a mass of flames. They made
sure that the fire could not extend to the surrounding
forest, which was just beginning to be
covered with an early crop of new leaves. Then
the whole company started through the thickets,
headed for the shore.
</p>
<p>
“Hang the luck! We forget one thing, after
all!” said Bluff suddenly.
</p>
<p>
He had been so busy getting several pictures
of the burning cabin that for the time being all
other things had escaped him.
</p>
<p>
“What was that?” asked Frank, winking at
Jerry knowingly.
</p>
<p>
“The wild man! We forgot to get him out
of that hollow tree!” exclaimed Bluff.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s too late now. For one, I object
to walking back there. Besides, we must hustle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
in order to make camp again against the coming
of the girls,” observed Frank seriously.
</p>
<p>
“But ain’t we ever going to know what the
mystery of that queer creature must be? Perhaps
we’d better write to that keeper we met
before, Mr. Smithson, and let him know. Then
if he’s shy a member of his happy family of lunatics,
he’ll know where to hunt for him,” Bluff
went on innocently.
</p>
<p>
“A bully good idea, and you can do the writing
when we get home, if you feel that way,”
said Frank, with a face that was as sober as that
of a judge, while Jerry had to turn his head away
to keep from laughing outright.
</p>
<p>
“But about the girls, fellows! Do you know
they may not come, after all. Perhaps the folks
have heard about the lively times down here on
Wildcat Island, and put a veto on the outing.
Then, again, you can hear the wind in the tops
of these tall trees, so there must be whitecaps on
the lake. It would be risky for a lot of girls to
embark on so long a trip,” observed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Well, boys, we’re going to turn aside here,
and make for a point where the tug is to meet us.
I want to thank you again. Don’t forget there’s
a nice little hundred waiting for you when you
want to claim it,” said Mr. Dodd, after a bit.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve decided that you are to turn that reward over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
to Tom Somers here. He was a great
help to us, and we’d like his family to get the
hundred, Mr. Dodd,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
Tom started to say something, then broke
down, and could only look at each of the three
boys with his heart in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Now for the place again. It’s tenting once
more on the old campground for us, fellows. I
hope Will has had the sense to cross over after
he saw the tug come, and the posse come ashore,”
remarked Frank.
</p>
<p>
They pushed through the dense growth stubbornly,
and in the course of time realized that
they were drawing near the open.
</p>
<p>
“One more rush, and we can pass around that
big bluff and see our place. There’s the lake,
and whitecaps, too. Too bad the girls can’t be
with us. What a yarn we’d have to tell ’em, eh,
fellows?” said Frank, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Thunder!” exclaimed Bluff just then.
</p>
<p>
“What’s happened to you, old sport?” asked
Jerry.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, through this opening! Ain’t that
the boat with the girls, out there in that jumping
sea? And side on, part of the time. Something’s
happened to ’em, that’s what, as sure as
you’re born!” ejaculated Bluff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
</p>
<p>
The others looked, and also uttered exclamations
of dismay, while Frank called out:
</p>
<p>
“They seem to have only one oar, and Nellie’s
trying to steer with that. Much she knows about
sculling! Oh! They were nearly over that time!
My heart’s in my mouth. Run for the shore,
boys! If only Will has come in with our canoes!”
</p>
<p>
And plunging like mad through the remaining
brush, the three lads broke out upon the little
beach, just where they had first landed when coming
to Wildcat Island to camp.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV—THE RESCUE—CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
“Will’s here!” shouted Jerry, as they broke
cover.
</p>
<p>
“Into the canoes, then, as fast as you can!”
exclaimed Frank.
</p>
<p>
He had given one frantic look out on the lake.
This had shown him that as yet the helpless boat
containing the four girls had not capsized, though
with every wave it seemed liable to turn over,
having broached to in the heavy running seas.
</p>
<p>
The way they threw out the contents of the
canoes was a caution. Packages fairly covered
the little beach, to the bewilderment of Will, who
just then came out of the bushes, where he had
been placing his first load, and who must have
believed at first that his three chums had gone
stark mad.
</p>
<p>
Then the canoes were launched. This in itself
was no easy task, but Frank and his chums were
experts at handling the small craft, and had often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
practised all manner of tricks with the boats while
in swimming.
</p>
<p>
Through the breaking surf that rushed up on
the shore they ran with the canoes. Then jumping
in, they seized the paddles, and started to
work furiously.
</p>
<p>
Success attended their efforts, and presently
they were moving swiftly toward the rolling rowboat,
in which crouched the four frightened girls.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down, and keep still! We’ll get you all
right!” bawled Frank, as he saw one of the girls
make an effort to use the remaining oar.
</p>
<p>
So they came alongside. Frank breathed a
prayer of thanksgiving when his hand caught the
gunwale of the skiff.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve got the boat to hold two of you. Nellie,
can you climb over, if I hold on tight?” he asked
his sister; “and you, too, Violet, will you dare?”
</p>
<p>
Nellie made the change easily enough, and then
came Will’s sister. Meanwhile, the other boys
had decided to convoy the rowboat in with its
remaining passengers, rather than attempt the
risky task of transferring them out there on the
rough lake.
</p>
<p>
They made fast, one on either side, and began
to paddle with the waves. In this way the entire
number finally found themselves safely ashore.
</p>
<p>
“We hardly expected you’d try it in this wind,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
said Frank, as he helped Violet up the beach to
the deserted camp.
</p>
<p>
“But the wind came up after we started, and
we couldn’t go back to save our lives, you see,”
she explained, laughing a little hysterically.
</p>
<p>
“But what does this mean? Where is your
camp, boys? It looks as though everything is
done up just as you left home,” said Mame Crosby,
as she eyed the many packages which the others
were now busily gathering together.
</p>
<p>
At that they all looked at each other and burst
into roars of laughter.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a long story, girls, and we’ll spin it while
we sit around the fire having dinner. As it’s now
long past noon, and there’s a heap to do getting
the camp fixed again, you must excuse us. Bluff,
start the fire going, and the girls can help us
out by taking charge of dinner while we build
our camp,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
Things began to assume the old-time air in
less than half an hour. Of course, the girls chattered
like magpies as they worked, but all their
appeals for information fell on deaf ears until
they were sitting around, in picnic style, enjoying
the splendid dinner, which was helped out by the
delicious things brought from home.
</p>
<p>
“And to think how near we came to feeding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
the fishes with these, too,” said Susie Prescott,
as she helped Will to a second portion.
</p>
<p>
“Now please take pity on us, and explain what
has happened. We’re just dying by inches to
know. What was that tug doing down here, with
all those men? And unless I’m mistaken, I saw
Mr. Dodd, the sheriff, aboard. He was out hunting
those two bad tramps who robbed the steamboat.
Oh, boys! Do you mean to say you have
had anything to do with them?”
</p>
<p>
Nellie had brought it to the point where explanations
must be in order. So the story was
told in detail. Sometimes one of the campers related
a certain part, and then another took it up
from where he left off.
</p>
<p>
“And with what views Bluff took for me, I’ll
have enough to illustrate the whole performance.
A few I’ve missed, and they will always haunt
me. Altogether it’s been a remarkable series of
adventures,” declared Will enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>
“The most astonishing that will ever come our
way, I reckon,” said Jerry with emphasis.
</p>
<p>
But though they did not dream of it at that
time, there were still stranger things fated to befall
the four chums ere many months had passed.
These happenings of vacation time will appear
in the next volume of this series, to be entitled
“The Outdoor Chums in the Forest; or, Laying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
the Ghost of Oak Ridge,” which will tell of the
weird experiences our friends met with while investigating
the greatest mystery that ever troubled
the neighborhood of Centerville.
</p>
<p>
The merry party had just about finished their
dinner when Bluff once again began to take his
comrades to task for not thinking to rout the
wild man out of his hole in the tree while they
had the help of the sheriff’s posse.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a chance we’ll never have again, and no
doubt the poor old fellow would be better off if
turned over to Mr. Smithers, at the asylum. Have
any of you girls heard of a lunatic at large since
winter?” he kept on, until both Frank and Jerry
could stand it no longer.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a shame to keep you in the dark any
longer, Bluff. To tell you the truth, we captured
that wild man,” said Frank as soon as he could
control his face.
</p>
<p>
“Captured him? When? How? Where?
You’ve been having a joke all to yourselves. It’s
time you let me in, boys,” he said positively.
</p>
<p>
Frank ripped open the newspaper package he
had carried all the way from the lone cabin in
the jungle. Then he held something up that first
provoked exclamations of wonder and then
shrieks of laughter from the girls. Bluff turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
red in the face, but being good-natured, he finally
joined in the mirth.
</p>
<p>
“So that’s what it was, eh? That big tramp
dressed himself up in that monkey skin they stole
from Dr. Aiken’s collection, over in the store-house,
when they entered. Waddy knew about
the story of the wild man said to be on this island,
and meant to have Biffins play the part to frighten
off any posse that might land. A clever idea, yes;
and I guess he did have considerable fun with
it,” Bluff went on.
</p>
<p>
“Jerry knew, of course, for he was a prisoner,
and saw the fellow dressing to carry out the part;
but I gave him the wink, and he kept quiet,” said
Frank.
</p>
<p>
“But how did you know?” demanded Will.
</p>
<p>
“I just guessed it. Sort of put two and two
together, you see. The footprints gave me a clue.
Then I watched the fellow carefully when he was
coming out of the tree, and going in later. I
believed it was a man, and he seemed to know
too much to be a lunatic; but I thought I’d have
a little fun with you and Bluff.”
</p>
<p>
“Into the tree, yes, but how do you explain
that? We saw him go in that hole in the hollow
stump, and he didn’t come out again, yet Biffins
was in the cabin when my stinging smoke made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
them surrender. There’s something queer about
that.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right there is, Bluff. I saw how the
thing was done when I went inside the cabin,
after they had been made prisoners. In the front
room was a hole in the floor. I jumped in that,
and found, just as I expected, that it was a nice
little underground tunnel leading to that hollow
tree. Years ago, the man who lived there must
have constructed that as a means of escape from
some imaginary danger. When Biffins entered
that tree he simply kept along until he reached
the cabin; but neither of them dared try to escape
that way, because they saw me standing guard,”
remarked Frank calmly.
</p>
<p>
“Well! Talk about your mysteries, this one
beats the band! But that fellow who died in the
cabin did have a reason to be afraid, Frank. I
understand he turned out to be a man who was
wanted for a capital crime down in New York
City. Perhaps he dreamed of the time when he
should be tracked to his hiding-place, and meant
to have a chance for escape,” observed Jerry.
</p>
<p>
They passed the hairy disguise around. Bluff
even stood up to show how it had fitted the big
man, at which Will uttered a cry of delight.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! now I know how I can get a picture of
the wild man for our collection. Bluff, some day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
won’t you just put that thing on, and let me
snap you off? It will be a real kindness, and I
think you will be pleased with the result,” he
exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
At which poor Bluff glared at him, and subsided,
while the girls went into new spasms of
laughter.
</p>
<p>
Dinner was made as elaborate as possible, and
in spite of what had happened the girls and the
boys did full justice to all that was set before
them. As they ate they talked the happenings
over again. They all had fun with the disguise,
and when one of the girls tried it on, everybody
screamed with laughter.
</p>
<p>
“The wild girl from Peru,” said Frank.
</p>
<p>
“The Wildcat Island belle,” came from Jerry.
</p>
<p>
And then another shout of laughter arose.
</p>
<p>
Dinner over, the boys gallantly ferried the girls
over to a dock at which the steamboat would stop
on her round of the lake. Here they laughed
and joked until the <em>Eastern Star</em> came along, when
the four girls started home.
</p>
<p>
Captain Amos leaned over the rail and heard
the news with delight, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Glad to hear it, fellows. Knew those hoboes
would regret it if ever they ran across the tracks
of you four. So they’re in the lock-up by this
time, and Mr. Pemberton’s packet of jewelry is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
recovered. Hurrah for the Rod, Gun and Camera
Club!”
</p>
<p>
So the little steamboat sheered off, the paddles
began to beat the water, and our boys waved their
hats in farewell as the girls returned the salute
with their dainty handkerchiefs. After which,
Frank and his chums headed once more for Wildcat
Island to finish their Easter outing, so strangely
interrupted.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
